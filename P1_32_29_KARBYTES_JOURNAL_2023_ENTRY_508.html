<p><strong>KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_ENTRY_508</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Before I went downtown to buy some groceries and coffee, I was lamenting over the fact that, if I can only save $10 per week, it would take me until November 2023 to save up approximately $200. After I did my shopping, I was relieved to see that I was able to effortlessly save $7 and not feel deprived of what I looked forward to buying and consuming. I checked my expected expenses (which are enumerated in <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_428/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journal entry # 428 of the year 2023</a>) and saw that my total annual membership fees amount to approximately $250 (rounded up, of course).</p>
<p>I saw an old lady walk by with her golden retriever on a leash and thought they both looked happy. Earlier I saw a rottweiler sitting in a parked van staring out the open door. I thought to myself about how dogs have been domesticated by humans to be helpful and extremely loyal to humans and, in some cases, helplessly dependent on humans for survival. I cannot comfortably as I did prior to the year 2016 justify owning a dog. After my cannabis-induced period of &#8220;awakening&#8221; in early 2016, my sensibilities have changed. Within the past year (and especially within the past six months) I have become a lot more solidified in what my ontological and ethical precepts are. I am not as approving of how humans conduct themselves as I used to be prior to 2016. Instead, I am much more openly critical and shunning of other people than I used to be based on how they conduct themselves and seem to think and emote (though I don&#8217;t want to get all tangled up in a long-winded tangent trying to articulate the specifics of what I despise about other humans). I consider dog owners to be lacking in sufficient consciousness about how they insist on keeping canine prisoners for the selfish amusement of humans. If it were up to me, non human animals would no longer be kept on leashes or in cages by humans. I would permit all dogs to either live outside or to be painlessly euthanized (particularly the dogs which likely won&#8217;t fare well). The bigger dogs can probably survive if humans leave food and water for them. Perhaps too many humans would complain about rampant dog poop, feral dogs mauling little kids, and dogs blocking traffic in the streets. Hence, I really advocate for euthanizing all the domesticated dogs and the abolishment of keeping animals confined to leashes or cages (unless transporting them to the hospital or for traveling long distances).</p>
<p>I think female humans are essentially dogs in human civilization (which, at least historically speaking, is fundamentally patriarchal (i.e. male centric and male led)). A woman without a male owner is (at least historically speaking) is not expected to fare well because she will be relegated to the streets and be forced to beg, resort to prostitution, and be vulnerable to dangerous conditions if not left to die. A man is generally treated as self-owning, self-sovereign, and a lot more able bodied and able minded (which means life for him is not expected to be nearly as difficult as it would be for a woman).</p>
<p>I have written extensively about my motivations to take on a masculine-androgynous gender identity and why I intend to stay on testosterone for the remainder of my life in past blog posts. In a relatively recent <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_502/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>, I said that I am rejecting womanhood and taking testosterone injections as a means to look, feel, sound, and think more like a man (and to be as physically strong as a man). I wrote in that blog post that I see no value in being a woman and went so far as to insinuate that womanhood should be made obsolete. If all women took male level testosterone and all human procreation was outsourced to machines, I think society would be very egalitarian and happier (but right now I think the patriarchy is still firmly in place and has women brainwashed into feeling trapped and obligated into being bitch slaves to men; as devoid of self-sovereignty and intrinsic self worth as domesticated dogs). Otherwise, women would not want to exhibit feminine attributes such as kid voice, swollen mammary glands, fragile bones, underdeveloped muscles, underdeveloped mathematical and spatial reasoning, excessive subcutaneous fat, and lethargy. Many of the most insecure cisgendered men might as well commit suicide over no longer having cisgendered women at their disposal. Good riddance! That would be an example of Darwinian natural selection weeding out those who can adapt to modern circumstances from those who cannot.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Honestly, I think male-to-female transsexuals are trying to get female privilege through the instrument of the patriarchy. In other words, I think MTFs are opportunists exploiting chauvinism the same basic way cisgendered female prostitutes would. Meanwhile, I consider FTM transsexuals (taking hormones) to be acquiring absolute power they would not otherwise have (and such power is evident in the wilderness where brute strength is a survival advantage).</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>By being an FTM transsexual, I do not consider myself to be siding with the patriarchy (and what I consider to be the patriarchy is cultural and civilization reinforcement and normalization of males subjugating females).</p>
<p>Note that the ideas I express in my blog are mainly for catharsis and not necessarily meant to be interpreted as instructions for how to change the world. I do not mean to demand that all domesticated dogs be rendered extinct through mass euthanasia. I also do not mean to eradicate female secondary sexual characteristics in all humans. What I mean to express is the discomfort I feel about the existence of people who are forced to be effeminate against their will (and I cannot help but imagine that, deep down, all women secretly wish to be masculine-androgynous instead of feminine and to have the biological advantages males have in terms of strength, stamina, mental prowess, and not having to look so neonatal and so eroticized as a consequence of sexual selection of such traits and cultural reinforcement of such traits). Now that modern means exist to imbue biological women with many of the essential secondary sexual characteristics of biological men, women could effectively renounce femininity and operate as sterile men. (Note that a biological woman who takes testosterone consistently for over a month consistently and continues to do so afterwards is not able to get pregnant). I have a copper intrauterine device implanted in my uterus for extra protection.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>In the past (back before I went to college for the first time), I thought that the only way for me to pass for male would be to keep my body super lean by hardly eating more than I needed to sustain my body and whatever physical and mental activity I did. Then I went online and was surprised to see how a human who is biologically female could grow facial hair and develop muscalature and body fat distribution which is very convincinlgy manly (and what I though only biological men were capable of). Also, I was surprised to see how much a biological female could permanently alter its voice through taking testosterone such that its voice ended up sounding as low pitched as that of an adult male. I found those things out in late 2008 and started taking testosterone under a phycisian&#8217;s guidance and with approval from mental health professionals at a clinic in San Francisco for queer youths.</p>
<p>I have been criticized many times in recent months over how vain I am for taking testosterone seemingly only to prevent myself from accumulating fat stores and for having a leaner physieue with much less effort and without having to go on a diet without such steroids. I am not going to compete professionally in any athletic challenges nor bother changing my legal name nor legal gender (but I probably will sign up for some kind of 5K race for fun one of these days and run in it just to have a good time and get free t-shirts and beer at the end). The people who gave me the most criticism for taking steroids were cisgendered heterosexual men who seem to think that I am mutiliating my body and getting rid of what those guys think makes me worth their time to pay attention to. Also, I do think they are legitimatley threatened that I will be able to seriously compete with them in all domains considered to be traditionally masculine. I do not think they want me to outperform them at such endeavors. Hence, any opposition I have received seems to be solely to protect the fragile patriachal male ego from feeling usurpeded by a biological female.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>This was a bit awkward for me to write (but so has been many other posts I have written and published online for a global audience). I am no stranger to being awkward in public and doing things which I think are embarassing. I do not really care that much about making a spectacle and circus freak of myself in public. <span style="background:#ffff00">All I really care about is maximizing my freedom and being successful in the endeavors I set out to do. That&#8217;s it. Nothing else really matters much to me (though I do worry about the long term survival of humanity, environmental preservation, promoting culturally progressive ideals, and abolishing slavery (because, if it is voluntary, it is volunteerism), forced torture (because, if it is voluntary, it is BDSM), forced poverty (because, if it is voluntary, it is bohemianism), forced illiteracy (because, if it is voluntary, it is a regressive lifestyle), and forced medical negligence (because, if it is voluntary, it is bodily autonomy).</span></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Well, I would like to move on with my blog and hopefully not keep bringing up sexual politics and other banal and petty subject matter again. Perhaps I will clear my mind by binge reading the news. Then, later on after I feel mentally refreshed from the dreary old subjects I have addressed in this entire blog, I plan on getting back to work on renovating my primary website. (I hear people frequently honk and make loud vocal interjections seemingly in response to me thinking certain thoughts as though I am being heavily surveilled and pressurized by other people in my midst who are eager to make me feel smothered, oppressed, and unable to switch mental gears. I am in great dread over the idea that other people are stalking, surveilling, and interfering with me in order to prevent me from moving on with my life and keeping me trapped in perpetual fighting over petty subject matter because that is all those people seem able to handle me doing).</p>
<p>If I could sum up the political opposition which is waged against me, it sounds like a campaign whose slogans might as well be, &#8220;Save the titties! Keep the women small-minded and upset. Only men are allowed to have fun. Keep the wombs pumping out the next generation of soldiers of the patriarchy. A woman is to defer to men; not to compete with them. A woman is here to soothe and comfort men; not to make him feel bad. Keep alive the tradition of humiliating, frustrating, and torturing women for men&#8217;s sadistic amusement and to reinforce men&#8217;s sense of superiority over women. (A good woman puts up with such antics with grace, humility, humbleness, and feigned contentment knowing that she will be treated much worse if she does not).&#8221;</p>

<p>Update: I have reason to believe that my father has been trying to pick fights with me and to make me feel deprived of a place to sit down and not be physically intruded upon. He seems to tell lies quite often and pretend not to be able to mentally process things (presumably so that he gets to be treated like an innocent little kid rather). I think he has stolen some of my belongings including mail. He has acted angry and sullen whenever I seem happy and he seems happiest when I feel ambushed and disrespected. He does things I&#8217;m sure he knows I don&#8217;t like such as smoke cigarettes in his house and try to get me to stop when I&#8217;m walking to get in the passenger seat of his car and offer me eggs even though I&#8217;ve been a vegan for years. He seems to do nothing with his life but wait for drama to unfold while claiming to be minding his own business. I could go into more detail and enumerate many examples of what I presume is my dad being a bully and drama monger but I decided to stop here and say that I thought about making up some violent offense which my dad committed against me in order to have him handcuffed and sent to prison but I would rather not make life for anyone harder than it has to be. I&#8217;m hoping that people who read this note will be able to read through the lines and see that I&#8217;m not really at odds with anyone other than less than five people who I think have been trying to make me miserable for years. I figure that such people suffer enough from the natural consequences of their behavior. Just because they are miserable and seemingly unwilling to change their behavior for the better does not mean I should have to settle for being just as miserable and lacking in self discipline as they are. It&#8217;s not my responsibility to be those people&#8217;s care taker or life coach or scapegoat.</p>

<p>I deleted the note which I added to GitHub as Draft.txt with the following commit comment:</p>
<p><em>Brea the peacemaker convinced me to not add this update to my blog.</em></p>
<p>That was in response to my cat running across the street to greet me after I returned from sitting about a block away from the house to write the note which I deleted from GitHub. Brea was crossing my path every time I tried to inch towards the house where I left my laptop to charge and, when Brea placed herself in front of me, she rolled around happily on the ground and acted extra cuddly and affectionate. So I decided to sit down and remove Draft.txt because I wanted to let bygones be bygones. Then Brea froze and looked up the driveway at the gray cat from next door who was sitting there watching with yellow eyes. After a few minutes both cats seemed to not be surprised nor agitated by each other&#8217;s presence. Then both cats moved such that they each left the premises. Then I went inside to my room where my laptop was charging and noticed the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_138/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sonic harassment</a> from police get extremely irritating again. I would say that whoever is harassing me with those noises as at least as bad as any person I have ever known on a personal level in terms of how much they seem to be negatively interfering with my life (and getting away with it). I decided to include these notes in my latest journal entry.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I registered for an event on 28_JUNE_2023 which might land me a job at the logistics company I formerly worked at. So far I am not sure whether or not I am going to attend the event. Also, I made an update to <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_503/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journal entry # 503 of 2023</a> earlier today.</p>

<p>Update: Earlier today I heard the thought police say that they did not want to support me writing a book. This afternoon they said, &#8220;You look like a science major who isn&#8217;t allowed to be anything but an abuse victim. You look like all you wanna be is an abuse victim.&#8221; I asked them if this is a case of, &#8220;Don&#8217;t cry or we will give you something to cry about,&#8221; and they said yes and, &#8220;We decided you can&#8217;t do anything but procrastinate. We didn&#8217;t expect you to get very far anyway. We decided you can only handle being an abuse victim because that&#8217;s all you ever talk about. You can&#8217;t do anything but procrastinate. That&#8217;s what you get for not having anything but your family to talk about. You look like you belong in a mental hospital. You&#8217;re too stupid to come up with anything to say to us. What&#8217;s the matter, you can&#8217;t code? Aww. All you can do is cry. Are you obsessed with what a teenage female you are? You&#8217;re only allowed to talk about yourself. You&#8217;re not an actual nerd. You&#8217;re a narcissist. Go to bed. Stop thinking about nothing but yourself. At least I don&#8217;t have to go to work looking so bedridden. Looks like you have nothing to do. You&#8217;re only allowed to hang out with us. Stop being such a self help guru. You need to get the fuck over yourself. You&#8217;re to insecure to use your own mouth. You&#8217;re too insecure to use your own brain. Get over yourself. Stop making yourself look like an abuse victim. Not everything is about you, okay? Nab nab nab. He needs to get over his face. Stop mowing at your own face. Bye! No one wants you to do anything but touch yourself. Ha ha ha! Am I interrupting your moment. Oh no! You don&#8217;t need to do anything but look too good to go to school. We&#8217;re not that narcissistic. You are! Bye Karlina! You&#8217;re not allowed to anything but be a self help abuse victim.&#8221; They continue to barrage me with verbal abuse as I write this note. Also, when I ask them questions, they almost never give me serious nor helpful answers. I think law enforcement is trying to torture me into social conformity and perhaps they are even torturing me for their own sadistic amusement. I don&#8217;t think they like me. Hence, they do not seem to be at all opposed to bullying me. Seemingly no one can stop them because they are at at the top of the food chain in a covert totalitarian military dictatorship.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">I think I am being terrorized into saying almost nothing such that I am practically mute. In time, I might only talk about computer programming, abstract philosophy, logistics, and other things which are purely utilitarian, apolitical, and impersonal for the sake of taking care of essential business and little else. In time, I might appear to be a human-shaped robot which hardly says anything other than stuff pertaining to dry, impersonal academics and mundane survival tasks and events. I hope that is the case. That means I will appear to have no personality and be very boring, unemotional, and low maintenance.</span></p>

<p>Update: As soon as I sat down in my yard to eat a snack and then observe the cats, I thought I heard some neighbors talking in a scolding manner to discourage me from enjoying myself outside. I seem to be living next to people who are opposed to me simply sitting and observing the world around me and having random thoughts in an unhurried manner. They act like I have to be shooed back indoors and prevented from enjoying my own backyard. It makes me imagine having robots shoot them all dead so that nicer, less controlling neighbors can move into fill their place. Wherever I go in Castro Valley to sit down and contemplate, other people almost always show up and honk their car horns or vocalize in a caustic manner several times per minute (but especially when I&#8217;m trying to focus my mind on something other than humans in my vicinity). I could be misinterpreting the sounds other people make as those people trying to discourage me from having thoughts other than what those people approve of, but I&#8217;ve noticed this type of phenomenon daily while in Castro Valley more so than in other places I&#8217;ve hung out in. I think Castro Valley is a very dogmatically communal and nuclear family oriented place. I noticed that women in this place hardly go outside their houses and cars without other people or dogs accompanying them and they almost never seem to be doing anything cerebral such as reading a book or using a laptop like the guys I&#8217;ve seen in coffee shops. It&#8217;s like everyone in this town (unless they are very old) has to be constantly interacting with other people in close physical proximity at all times and constantly chatting. I wonder if residents of this town are trying to make me so uncomfortable that I leave the town. It feels that there is an all-out war on karbytes being waged; a campaign to mercilessly engulf me and to deprive me of privacy so that I am unable to seriously relax and enjoy the things I live for and feel other people are trying to take me away from. That is the number one reason I feel misanthropic (though humanity&#8217;s general and extremely popular and cavalier disregard for environmental sustainability and continued dependence on fossil fuels is a close second).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">What I want more than anything is to be able to live alone and to pursue my hobbies unencumbered by other people or by disabling medical or environmental conditions. That does not seem to leave much room for friends. I do not see much of a need for friends when the Internet provides me all the human interaction I feel I need.</span></p>
