<p>Earlier today I was reading a Wikipedia article about <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_feminism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;radical feminism&#8221;</a>. I think that the most effective way for women to truly overcome the patriarchy which oppresses them is to physically alter their bodies with male hormones and technological augmentation in order to be at least as physically and mentally powerful as men; to close the sexual dimorphism gap and the gender roles gap such that femininity is relegated to a vestigial thing of the past; an arcane disability that only exists as a means to appeal to the male ego in exchange for his provisions and protections. A huge reason why I take testosterone is to be as physically strong as a man and to physically appear to be more intimidating rather than vulnerable and made to exploit. I do not consider myself to be a radical feminist because what I advocate for is the abolishment of womanhood instead of abolishment of the patriarchy. My most recent Instagram comment on a post about recent anti abortion laws proliferating in the United States is part of my &#8220;radical&#8221; agenda. What I promote is every human becoming as self sufficient and powerful as possible and augmenting itself with technology. I believe that it will only be a matter of time before machines do the bulk of human civilization&#8217;s essential labor while every human receives a livable universal basic income. In such circumstances, humans will have few if any incentives to ingratiate themselves to each other the way a prostitute or starving beggar would. Lastly, even machines would be doing the incubating of fetuses (which are grown from human <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stem cells</a>) and the optimizing of human genomes and carefully calibrating human birth rates and gene mixing to ensure that population density and genetic diversity is optimal for human welfare. Meanwhile, all the humans born in such a society would be innately sterile so that they can focus on more noble endeavors than reproductive politics. The machines would not churn out more babies than what the existing humans really want and are capable of adequately taking care of.</p>
<p>By the way, because I have zero desire to sexually reproduce and zero desire to get into a romantic relationship, I am aware that I am an evolutionary stub in my genetic lineage (but once I get the results from my 23AndMe genetic test, I will upload my genome to GitHub and license it as open source so that anyone can use my genome for any purpose it wants to (including making human clones)). I am also aware that not very many humans are likely to emulate my lifestyle nor adopt my philosophy. I do not expect to revolutionize human civilization by publishing these notes online, but I do hope to entertain and inspire people through my art.</p>
