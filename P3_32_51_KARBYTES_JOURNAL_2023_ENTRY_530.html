I was thinking about a time approximately more than one year ago (back when I still had a bicycle and was hanging out near the East Dublin BART station) when I watched a music video by the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillaz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gorillaz</a> of the song named <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humility_(song)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Humility</a> in which 2D was skating around on roller skates having fun by himself while the other members of his band were hanging out on the side lines. Noodle was playing chess with some black guy and on a basketball court and apparently impressing him with her moves. Murdoc was standing by on that same basketball court looking more dolled-up and effeminate than normal, and Russel was standing by waiting to trip 2D with his foot, which he did, and which caused 2D to briefly take a tumble and then get back up to continue roller skating. That song made me want to be like 2D and get on my bike and go have some fun gliding around in the streets. That song also made me wonder why Russel tripped 2D. I feel that I can relate to 2D in that I feel that other people angrily stand by and seem to be disapproving me of having fun by myself. What if everyone was as free to have fun by themselves? Might the world be a happier place? If everyone was able to enjoy being alone and doing solitary hobbies by themselves even in the midst of other people without triggering other people&#8217;s jealousy, I do think there would be almost no intentional human-caused violence. What I am suggesting is that I will be punished by (some) other people unless I hide from them how much fun I am having without including them in my fun. The kind of fun I have is not about taking away other people&#8217;s fun. Perhaps the people who think they should try to prevent me from having fun without including other people are not very happy people. Hence, they might only really want to interact with other people if they are all part of a &#8220;misery loves company&#8221; club. </p>
<p>Also, I have gotten a lot of flack from people merely for preferring to eat healthy, stay fit, and study instead of &#8220;let myself go&#8221; like they apparently have. I do worry about losing my physical and mental capacities and lifespan as a consequence of high stress (mostly caused by interpersonal conflicts), high exposure to environmental toxicity and radiation (mostly caused by humans using outdated infrastructure which pollutes the environment even though pollution free alternatives are available because the polluting means are cheaper and more conveniently available), and assimilating to other people&#8217;s relatively unhealthy lifestyle habits as a means to prevent people from ostracizing me, punishing me, and blocking my access to resources I want and need. Hence, I see very little reason to make friends with people and to hang out with people outside the context of shared professional and hobbyist interests. I suppose that means I am not much of a humanitarian. It seems like, as long as people keep having more babies than they can adequately provide for, there will always be people going without basic necessities. Oh well. Sucks for them. I am not going to deprive myself of a nice Silicon Valley lifestyle just to go take time off to move to Africa to teach otherwise illiterate children how to read or something. In time, I think that the innovations of the western world will be made affordable, scalable, and accessible to everyone such that poverty and illiteracy will be virtually nonexistent throughout the human population. </p>
<p>In summary: I will do my best to not squander my fortunate circumstances, education, skills, passion, and good health even at the risk of being called an elitist snob and someone who does not do enough to share my good fortune with others (because I believe that me focusing on my personal goals instead of neglecting them to focus on what other people want me to do instead is the best way I can contribute something of genuine value to human civilization; something that can help elevate the quality of people&#8217;s thoughts in the form of open source web pages, source code, and media files; something I can do other than &#8220;take a loss&#8221; so that other people do not feel as disenfranchised in comparison).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">Okay, I will try to &#8220;shut up&#8221; now and focus on taking care of my personal priorities. For now on, I intend to only blog about the finalization of <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a>, significant changes to my economic and health status, news pertaining to my academic interests (i.e. science, technology, mathematics, and philosophy), and what I consider to be significant accomplishments or acquisitions of valued commodities in my life.</span></p>
