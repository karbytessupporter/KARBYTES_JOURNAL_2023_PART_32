<p>If I knew I could get away with it, there is at least one person whom I would have thrown off of very tall cliff in order to have that person exterminated.&#8217;</p>

<p><em>You&#8217;re not doing enough to make it look like you have something other than yourself to focus on.</em></p>
<p><em>You need to stop making yourself the center of attention. You need to make someone other than yourself the center of attention.</em></p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s not okay for you to have this much time off from making other people the center of attention.</em></p>
<p><em>Make it look like you have something other than yourself to focus on. Otherwise, we will have you committed to a mental hospital against your will.</em></p>
<p><em>You need to be put in a restraining order against being able to listen to your own thoughts.</em></p>
<p><em>Get a job. Find something else to do besides wait for free money. Stop reading so many books. Stop acting like all you have to do is show off on the Internet.</em></p>
<p><em>Stop making women feel so infantilized. Stop making women feel like they have to turn into men. Let them be star of the show for a change. Women are not as self absorbed as you are. Help women feel appreciated for what they are: a lot less spoiled than you are. Women give back to their communities more than you do. Women make it look like they have something other than themselves to focus on.</em></p>
<p><em>Get over yourself. No one wants to listen to you anymore. Get over your self help book.</em></p>
<p><em>Everyone but you has friends. Everyone but you has something to listen to other than your boca.</em></p>
<p><em>You act like you have nothing to do. You don&#8217;t make it look like you have real world money. No wonder why no one wants to listen to you. No one wants to listen to your bible.</em></p>
<p><em>You act like you are the first and the last person in your life you need to make money for. I don&#8217;t want you to listen to anything other than your self absorbed father. All you think about is you all day. Make someone else money besides your self absorbed mouth.</em></p>
<p><em>Find someone else to talk about. Find someone other than yourself to live for. Stop making it all about Disney code. No wonder why you can&#8217;t get a job. You don&#8217;t want to make anyone other than yourself the center of your money. Give someone other than yourself the time of their life.</em></p>
<p><em>No wonder why you have no real world money. You need real world friends in order to have real world money.</em></p>
<p><em>Of course you need to make real world money. It&#8217;s not all about GitHub. Get over your self important Earth Day. Stop making it all about Barnes &amp; Noble.</em></p>
<p><em>You need to do something other than relax. Stop making it all about self care.</em></p>
<p><em>I don&#8217;t want to have to keep listening to you. Stop making me the center of attention. I wish you had an actual boyfriend.</em></p>
