<p><strong>KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_ENTRY_512</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Some people seem to think that I should be made to suffer at least as much as they do and that, whenever I am happy, I should be prevented from being happy and that my happiness should be treated as an offense deserving of their retaliation.</p>
<p>I just thought that I should mention that so that my readers are aware that I am aware of such &#8220;rules of the ghetto&#8221;.</p>
<p>The point of this note is not to go on and on about the various &#8220;rules of the ghetto&#8221;. I would rather narrow the focus of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this blog</a> more so than ever to focus exclusively on relatively &#8220;elitist&#8221; subject matter (and stuff which pertains exclusively to my interests and what I consider to be significant events occurring within my life).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">I would like to keep this blog chapter from growing past 40 journal entry web pages total and, before closing <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_part_32/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this chapter</a>, I would like to finish the final update of <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a> (which is expected to happen before 01_AUGUST_2023) and announce that fact in the form of a blog post within this chapter.</span></p>
<p>Within this blog chapter, I would also like to announce the acquisition of a bicycle (including cost, test rides, and brand/model). Events which I also hope to announce within this chapter include the release of my personal genome (which I ordered via 23AndMe and which is allegedly being sequenced now and will allegedly be available to view in July 2023) and getting my first paycheck at my next job. Other than that, <span style="background:#ffff00">I do not expect to blog about much else for the rest of this year (but new code, text, and media files are likely to be added to GitHub repositories which are referenced in the web page of this website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_code_continues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KARBYTES_CODE_CONTINUES</a>).</span></p>
<p><strike>There are people on the other side of this fence making impatient and unsupportive vocalizations as I write this note. I must have offended a lot of people today (and in the past) for things which I have said or done (or which people assume about me).</strike> Note that I rarely ever deliberately attempt to make people feel bad. My goal is not to deliberately make any person feel offended, but at the same time, my goal is be honest as possible and to share information which I think would be to my advantage to share. My desire to express information which I think is strategic to share takes precedence over my desire to not offend people. Otherwise, I would be too withholding of information and too insincere for me to feel proud of.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">As long as I am physically able to study rigorous subject matter and to express my understanding in the form of digital artifacts which I publish online, I intend to keep publishing content at least once per month for the remainder of my lifespan to this WordPress website or to my public GitHub repositories (and I consider the public GitHub repositories which are referenced in KARBYTES_CODE_CONTINUES to be extensions of this website and of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com). Finally, I intend to save each web page of this website, each web page of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com, and each file within the aforementioned GitHub repositories to the WayBack Machine (so that each of those resources is preserved in case my GitHub or WordPress websites get tampered with).</span></p>
<p><strike>The people on the other side of this fence continue to make plaintive caterwauling sounds. I don&#8217;t think they want me to finish this note and/or to accidentally leave out information I want this note to include and/or to make grammatical or syntactic errors. Soon (within the next hour of publishing this note), I will not be sharing so much of my thoughts and feeling in the form of public notes on the Internet (but I anticipate that people will still caterwaul in protest of me thinking in their midst a single thought strays outside the confines they want my thoughts to be restricted to). Introspection seems to be a criminally self indulgent act according to many people I come into close proximity to.</strike></p>
<p>Well, I better hurry up and publish this note and leave the premises. I am still in the suburbs. My destination after this is my relatively secluded camping spot in the wilderness away from suburban and urban territories. Thank you for your patience.</p>
