I can tell many people think that I should be bullied into looking for a job right now and to stay indoors at either one of my parent's places until I get a job (and to stop hanging out in public like a homeless person) because those people are tired of seeing me take up so much space in public and, also, their attention span and, also, because those people are not interested in Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com nor in me finishing the renovation of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com. (The main reason why I decided to allow myself to keep living solely on my mom's money until 01_AUGUST_2023 is to ensure that I have sufficient time to complete the renovation of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com to my satisfaction). 

I imagine those people would say something like, "Hardly anyone cares about your website, sweetie. It doesn't make any money either. All your website looks like is you showing off. It's not enough about serving people other than yourself. We think you should let other people and community oriented things take up more of your time. That website should not take up so much of your time. You shouldn't make such a big deal about it. Get some friends. Watch television shows other people watch. Become more relatable to us and then we will be more supportive of your existence. Otherwise, we just want to put you somewhere we don't have to be reminded of your existence."
