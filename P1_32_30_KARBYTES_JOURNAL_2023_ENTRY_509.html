<p>This note is to redress what I said in the previous <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_508/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">note</a>.</p>
<p>I take back what I said in that note and all notes like it. When I wrote that note, I wasn&#8217;t in a good state of mind. Now that I&#8217;m taking my psychiatric meds, my thoughts are a lot more coherent and less insane.</p>
<p>All jobs matter because all jobs serve humanity in some way. Otherwise, they wouldn&#8217;t net their workers any pay! Also, all real jobs pay taxes (which help fund social programs which you and me depend on when times are tough and money is tight).</p>
<p>If you got a disability which you didn&#8217;t choose to have and which prevents you from working, my heart goes out to you. You deserve to take disability payments to make ends meet. Otherwise, you&#8217;re a leech. End of story.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">Moral of the story: every able bodied adult under 65 needs a job in order to live with dignity.</span></p>
<p>(I don&#8217;t got a disability, but I do got a job as a delivery truck driver. I don&#8217;t worry about robots taking my job. Self driving cars are still a long way off from being safe enough to deploy on large scale. Also, I ain&#8217;t worried about global warming from continuing fossil fuels reliance. All that foo foo eco friendly energy is a long way off from being affordable and efficient. I&#8217;m all for drilling for more oil wherever it may be and mining for coal as well. Unlike what those fear mongering hippies tell you, human activity accounts for only a small fraction of climate patterns. And don&#8217;t let those grass eating pansies bully you into going vegetarian either. Man has become the apex predator he is from eating meat in large quantities. Kids need meat to develop into healthy functional adults with a fighting chance of winning the game at life and producing healthy offspring of their own. Well, I&#8217;d better get back to work now. I&#8217;m on my lunch break now. I got some freight to deliver (and it&#8217;s very important cargo: life-saving medicines like polio vaccine and such). That freight ain&#8217;t gonna deliver itself!)</p>
