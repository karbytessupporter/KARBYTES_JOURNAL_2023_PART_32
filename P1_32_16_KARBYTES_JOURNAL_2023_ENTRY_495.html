<p>I uploaded another picture of the region I&#8217;ve been camping at the last few days. The picture depicts the hills northeast of my neighborhood of legal residence in Castro Valley, California. The photograph was taken at approximately 7:00AM. The sky in that picture is overcast. The temperature of that scene is approximately 20 degrees Celsius. I am tentatively planning on going to Dublin, California within the next three days and making that my new camping spot because I&#8217;ve been bullied a lot in Castro Valley by people who seem to want to prevent me from living there and from working on my personal hobbies there. I would rather not deal with nor mention in this blog any more petty drama concerning such people. I would rather avoid mentioning in this blog any more of the verbal and psychological abuse I am  frequently subject to by thought police and by civilians (and I have documented such abuse in prior blog posts. Use the search term pig_gorl on this <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/666" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non web page&#8217;s search form</a> to locate such material). I would rather avoid confrontation and keep to myself and continue where I left off on my summer renovation of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com. Within the next three months I plan on getting a part time or full time hourly wage job (but I might get a job sooner or later than three months from now). Well, the temperature is dropping and the wind is picking up. Rain might be on the way. I better get moving and vacate the premises.</p>
