<p>In honor of the Fourth of July (i.e. <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States of America Independence Day</a> (or what I call it: Fireworks Day)), I decided to share the lyrics to one of my favorite songs of all time which pertains to some human getting its face and limbs blown off by explosives: <em>One</em> by <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metallica</a>. What I especially like about that song (besides the flawlessly good instrumentals) is the lyrics and how they tell the story of that explosion victim&#8217;s life following the explosion in a way which feels like what that person would likely be saying out loud and turning into a piece of art if he had the physical means to (but if he had the means to, the story would merely be fiction or remembrance instead of the &#8220;in the moment&#8221; lyrical and instrumental description of his nightmarishly solipsistic and sensory deprived experience).</p>
<p>Earlier today as I was about to walk into <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoneridge_Shopping_Center" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stoneridge Mall</a> to buy some coffee and to look at the many people walking around, sitting in the massage chairs, and selling things, I had the following (relevant) thoughts (which also pertain to the green highlighted paragraph in the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_526/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous journal entry web page</a>): <em>the real Karlina is conscious but basically now a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brain in a vat</a> hidden inside the body of Kar (like a passenger in a car) while karbytes (i.e. Karlina&#8217;s boyfriend or, more accurately, a devotee of and to Karlina) is driving that Kar and doing all the talking for Kar. Meanwhile, Karlina is only able to think, feel, and communicate non-verbally yet still in a very abstract way which seems out of touch with Kar&#8217;s sense of being oriented at some precise location inside of a space-time continuum which is a subset of a network of space-time continuums (and each individual person has its own unique and inevitably solipsistic space-time continuum which may include experiences of there being other persons inside of that person&#8217;s universe). Karlina is too pristine and relatively limitless to instantiate in such a relatively limited form as Kar is (and karbytes is basically an intermediary between Kar and Karlina (where Kar is the most physical of those three entities and, therefore the most limited of those three entities and where Karlina is the least physical of those three entities and the hardest of those three entities to define in precise terms)).</em></p>
<p>(I could go on to suggest that, metaphorically speaking, Kar is to Jesus (The Son) as karbytes is to God (The Father) as Karlina is to The Holy Spirit, but I think Christianity and most other religions are unnecessarily convoluted and out of touch with modern science and modern civilization).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">What I meant to imply with all those descriptions of Kar, karbytes, and Karlina is that karbytes is trying to create a cyberspace temple for Karlina named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a> which attempts to reflect Karlina&#8217;s divine essence (because Karlina itself (or, as some people would say, herself) is too immaterial to build something so material directly).</span></p>
<p>(Note that this website (i.e. <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a>) is my cyberspace basement which I call my home and which is &#8220;located beneath&#8221; (and <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(hyper)linked</a> to) the relatively small and pristine house referred to as Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com. I am karbytes. <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_527/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This web page</a> is one of the rooms of my home).</p>
<p>(Kar lives where automobiles generally go and, at this time, within the San Francisco Bay Area within walking distance of the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Rapid_Transit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bay Area Rapid Transit</a> (BART) stations. Sometimes Kar is where the cars cannot easily go such as on hiking trails and patches of undeveloped wilderness. Sometimes Kar is swimming underwater in some body of water such as a swimming pool, lake, river, or ocean. Sometimes Kar is suspended above <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Planet Earth</a>&#8216;s lithosphere in an aircraft or spacecraft. Eventually, Kar might be traveling through the space within the solar system to <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Planet Mars</a> and, if the space travel mission is successful, Kar might be thriving on Mars in a human-founded civilization).</p>
<p>Without further adieu, here are the lyrics to <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_(Metallica_song)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One</a> by Metallica (and the lyrics, &#8220;I cannot live. I cannot die,&#8221; sounds especially (to me) like pure consciousness describing itself within the context of a panpsychic worldview):</p>
<p><em>I can’t remember anything</em><br />
<em>Can’t tell if this is true or dream</em><br />
<em>Deep down inside I feel the scream</em><br />
<em>This terrible silence stops me</em></p>
<p><em>Now that the war is through with me</em><br />
<em>I’m waking up, I cannot see</em><br />
<em>That there’s not much left of me</em><br />
<em>Nothing is real but pain now</em></p>
<p><em>Hold my breath as I wish for death</em><br />
<em>Oh please, God, wake me</em></p>
<p><em>Back in the womb it’s much too real</em><br />
<em>In pumps life that I must feel</em><br />
<em>But can’t look forward to reveal</em><br />
<em>Look to the time when I’ll live</em></p>
<p><em>Fed through the tube that sticks in me</em><br />
<em>Just like a wartime novelty</em><br />
<em>Tied to machines that make me be</em><br />
<em>Cut this life off from me</em></p>
<p><em>Hold my breath as I wish for death</em><br />
<em>Oh please, God, wake me</em></p>
<p><em>Now the world is gone, I’m just one</em><br />
<em>Oh God, help me Hold my breath as I wish for death</em><br />
<em>Oh please, God, help me</em></p>
<p><em>Darkness</em><br />
<em>Imprisoning me</em><br />
<em>All that I see</em><br />
<em>Absolute horror</em><br />
<em>I cannot live</em><br />
<em>I cannot die</em><br />
<em>Trapped in myself</em><br />
<em>Body my holding cell</em></p>
<p><em>Landmine</em><br />
<em>Has taken my sight</em><br />
<em>Taken my speech</em><br />
<em>Taken my hearing</em><br />
<em>Taken my arms</em><br />
<em>Taken my legs</em><br />
<em>Taken my soul</em><br />
<em>Left me with life in hell</em></p>
