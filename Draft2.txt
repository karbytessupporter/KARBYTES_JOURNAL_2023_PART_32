I think that people are generally opposed to me not driving a car (especially as my means to commute to work if I have a non remote job). A bicycle won't do. Only a car will (because, unlike a bicycle or walking, a car lets you transport more than just yourself and what you can carry on your back). Also, a bicycle is not fast enough and too much physical labor and exposure to the elements to enable you to remain non-sweaty, dry, non-winded, and non-grimy. A bicycle is for leisure; not for serious commutes. Besides, everyone in Castro Valley knows you have access to your mom's minivan. In order to get the bullies to stop bullying you (and your family), you gotta get back in that car and stop walking around in public.
