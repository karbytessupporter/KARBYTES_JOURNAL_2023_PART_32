<p><strong>KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_ENTRY_521</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>To finalize what I said in the previous blog post, I have come to the conclusion that conforming to the female gender roles is generally a waste of time (especially given the fact that all human sexual reproduction can be outsourced to machines) because all it really amounts to is a woman advertising its sexual allure (which is the power to captivate and monopolize the attention economy) to a man-dominant audience in exchange for provisions bestowed on women by men at a price I would not want to pay: having to spend oneself broke in terms of finite resources obsessively and constantly attempting to control how one is is perceived by other people. Such focus on other people is crippling to the extent that I consider it to be an intellectual disability which is generally condoned across human civilization. Also, I honestly think women are generally not nearly as physically attractive as men generally are (because I think women look like deformed piggish children who look like they were domesticated and brainwashed into behaving like manipulative, dumbed down, pathetically easily amused whores) and because cisgendered men have superior physical strength and superior mental prowess (but I do think it is possible for some cisgendered women to achieve the same level if not exceed the same level of physical or mental prowess as cisgendered men but doing so would take an extremely high amount of effort and, honestly, exceptionally fortunate environmental circumstances). I am sorry if I offended any people. I know what I have said in this journal entry and elsewhere could be construed as misogyny. I hope that I do not get punished for expressing my (arguably) misogynistic viewpoints. I am glad I shared them though because, if I did not, I believe I would die with regrets and a lot of pain knowing that I had so much I could shared in writing with the world which likely would have saved many others from having to say the same things in their own words. In other words, I think that my words help other people with similar thoughts and feelings as mine not have to publically humiliate themselves and risk getting punished as a consequence of sharing their (arguably) misogynistic thoughts and feelings with people other than themselves.</p>
<p>Anyway&#8230;onto the gist of what this note is about&#8230;</p>
<p>I remember making a prayer in 2016 back when I briefly suspended rational judgment while under the influence of loads of marijuana while reading the Christian Bible and spending lots of time hiding in the wilderness to contemplate ideas which felt new, fresh, and inspiring at the time which sounded like accepting Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior and going so far as to do what I thought He was compelling me to do: physically be willing to take His place and endure ostracization, torture, and violence in order to carry out His divine mission. I was very egoless and brave at that time and I intuited that, once that novelty and magical spirituality glow faded, I would return to being highly egotistical, logical, skeptical, atheistic (and now pantheistic), and daresay misanthropic and bordering on suicidally depressed. Shortly after I made that oath, I ended up in the psychiatric ward for a manic break involving me attempting to run barefoot across the Golden Gate Bridge as part of some quest I felt I was being lead to embark on which included chasing after cryptic clues which I noticed in my environment left by other humans in the form of graffiti, artifacts, and strategically placed human characters who I regarded as benevolent guardians and guides along my path.</p>
<p>As my optimism and sense of being on a magical quest faded into pessimism and being scammed and deluded into wasting my time and getting entrapped in a situation which left me feeling trapped, tortured, gaslit, ostracized, maligned, stolen from, set up to fail, and daresay even physically harmed, I started to feel an intense degree of horror and anger at the shocking level of cruelty and sadism I noticed in seemingly innocent people (including children) who seemed to rejoice in me being treated as their scapegoat.</p>
<p>I remember people treating me like I deserved to be regarded as a saint willing to make sacrifices most others would not want to make in order to benefit all of humanity. I watched people gradually treat me less and less like a deluded and idealistic child saint and more and more like some infantilized adult who needed to be treated in a harsh and unkind manner. What I never seemed to get was much in the way of honest and direct verbal communication from other people. I felt that truth was one thing that other people have generally not been very forthcoming about giving me.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have lamented a lot throughout my blogging career about how abused and betrayed and used and lied to and raped and ignored and damaged by other people I have felt, but in all honesty, I feel way more priviledged and held in high esteem (especially by people in high ranks of governmental institutions) than disadvantaged or demonized.</p>
<p>I will never forget somehow finding a clue (I think in the form of graffiti) which said that the price of freedom is constant surveillance. That might be the most important point I am trying to make: that, in order for me to have so much freedom to travel alone and to live outside and to use the Internet as liberally as I have since 2016, I have had to succumb to being intensely surveilled by the government to an extent I think is tortuous and an extent I think most people would not volunteer to submit themselves to.</p>
<p>Well, these are just some hastily hashed out thoughts I felt the need to publish in this website before moving onto other things. Time to go!</p>
<p>(I know I have complained a lot. I am afraid that, the more I complain, the more I will be punished for it (even by myself). Therefore, I hope to stop complaining publicly after this. It is hard for me to move on with my life and avoid fighting with other people because, as soon as I try not to get into fights with other people, I get the sense that other people are trying to provoke me into fighting with them and do not stop until I give in and &#8220;snap&#8221;).</p>
<p>In response to that last paragraph I said: I think I am being obliged to &#8220;let other people win&#8221; whatever fights they pick with me and try to prevent from getting finished. &#8220;Letting others win&#8221; is hard for my ego to willingly do. Hence, I have to con myself into thinking there is no way for me to survive unless I do (and that, if I don&#8217;t, I will suffer so much that I will not want to live anymore).</p>
<p>Okay. I am ready to take damage. I am ready to give my all in trying to be perpetually optimistic and resilient and as minimally violent and minimally harmful as possible.</p>
