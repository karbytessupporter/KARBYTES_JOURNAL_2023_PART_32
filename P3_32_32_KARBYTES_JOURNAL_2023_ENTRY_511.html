<p>I went to Fremont early in order to attend tomorrow&#8217;s hiring event, but I am strongly considering not attending that event and leaving Fremont early because the people here seem very rude, uptight, angry, and loud. Also, the air quality sucks from high volume of fossil fuels combusting vehicles concentrated in a low-elevation area. I get the sense that many of the people here are uptight about me using my laptop and doing stuff which pertains to software development and intellectually rigorous academics when most of the people around here seem relatively &#8220;low brow&#8221;. There is a lot of honking of car horns and rumbling motorcycles which is getting a bit grating on my nerves. I miss the relative peace and naturalistic qualities of the region northeast of Lake Chabot were I have been doing a lot of website work and contemplation during the past few weeks. I do not mean to be prejudiced but I have noticed several &#8220;hints&#8221; (which I will not go into detail about) from the locals suggesting that I am not welcome here unless I act more like a (poor) chauvinist male supremacist. The honking is very obnoxious. The people around here resemble sulky, irritable teenagers. Also, I wonder if such people are against me getting along well with my parents and the people in my home town because the people who are against me getting along with the people in my hometown and parents want me to be deprived of a nicer lifestyle than what they have. I may be misinterpreting other people&#8217;s behavior as animosity towards me but my intuition is telling me that I am selling myself short by spending so much of my life down here.</p>
<p>If I had a bicycle, then it would be relatively easy and quick for me to get around without polluting. Because I walked and rode BART here, I feel that I am spending too much time inhaling pollution, being disturbed by caustic noises, and walking where there is practically zero places to get out of the sun and rain. If I attend the hiring event tomorow, then I might be offered a job relatively quikcly such that I could save up money for a bicycle relatively soon (but, in my opinion, not soon enough to make my time working to acquire that bicycle feel worthwhile and sufficiently humane). If I wait until I am done updating Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com, I might also have enough money saved up for a bicycle which I can order online and have delivered to my house (but I will have to assemble the bike).</p>
<p>At a certain point (and relatively soon), I hope to stop sharing so much of how I feel online and, instead, limit what I publish online to relatively impersonal and academic-oriented subject matter (and generally avoiding sharing my opinions about politics because I think that I have shared enough of my political opinions on this blog already to give my readers an idea of what my values, priorities, and beliefs generally are). Today I resurfaced the directory web page on this website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/minds_karbytes_2020_screenshots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MINDS_KARBYTES_2020_SCREENSHOTS</a> such that it is prominently featured on the home page of this website as the web page whose index number is one. (Apparently I am too soft-spoken, introverted, and gender-neutral to be accepted by the locals. Maybe I should just leave and let those road rage-aholics hog the air and fill it with their oppressive grime while their dead-faced women look on with subdued woundedness at the plight they seem resigned to make their home for the rest of their lives).</p>
