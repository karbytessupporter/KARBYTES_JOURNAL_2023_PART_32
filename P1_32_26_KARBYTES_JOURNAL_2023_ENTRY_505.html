<p>One of my goals (as controversial as it seems) is not relying on a petroleum powered vehicle (especially one I don&#8217;t own) as my primary means of transportation. Hence, I strive to continue only relying on ecologically sustainable and &#8220;communist&#8221; means of transportation to get between my living area and my future place of (paid (and tax paying)) employment by walking, bicycling, or riding BART trains. (I hope to own a fully electric car someday such as the (two-seater and 100% electric) <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_electric_drive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smart Car</a> and, when I do travel outside the San Francisco Bay Area, I am open to other transportation means such as airplane, train, taxis, and car rental).</p>
<p>I am attempting to save up money for a cheap (mechanical (i.e. non-motorized (i.e. 100% human-powered))) <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bicycle</a> to order <strike>to pick up in store</strike> from Amazon dot Com to have delivered to my house within the next two months. (I saw that I will have to manually assemble the bicycle if it is delivered. That&#8217;s fine. I don&#8217;t mind doing that part myself. It&#8217;s hundreds of dollars cheaper to order a mountain bike from Amazon than to buy a pre-assembled mountain bike from a specialty bike store. Also, pre-assembling my own bike is a good learning experience and something I should know how to do as someone who intends to heavily use a bike to get around. I will have to become my own bike mechanic so that I am not too dependent on other people to get around. Finally, I saw (adult) mountain bikes for sale on Amazon dot Com which are priced at less than $200).</p>
<p>Also, I made another <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_PART_32/main/pig_boi_24_june_2023.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a> recording of my impersonation of what I hear from sonic harassment and uploaded that video to GitHub.</p>
