Before I went downtown to buy some groceries and coffee, I was lamenting over the fact that, if I can only save $10 per week, it would take me until November 2023 to save up approximately $200. After I did my shopping, I was relieved to see that I was able to effortlessly save $7 and not feel deprived of what I looked forward to buying and consuming. I checked my expected expenses (which are enumerated in journal entry # X of the year 2023) and saw that my total annual membership fees amount to approximately $250 (rounded up, of course).

I saw an old lady walk by with her golden retriever on a leash and thought they both looked happy. Earlier I saw a rottweiler sitting in a parked van staring out the open door. I thought to myself about how dogs have been domesticated by humans to be helpful and extremely loyal to humans and, in some cases, helplessly dependent on humans for survival. I cannot comfortably as I did prior to the year 2016 justify owning a dog. After my cannabis-induced period of "awakening" in early 2016, my sensibilities have changed. Within the past year (and especially within the past six months) I have become a lot more solidified in what my ontological and ethical precepts are. I am not as approving of how humans conduct themselves as I used to be prior to 2016. Instead, I am much more openly critical and shunning of other people than I used to be based on how they conduct themselves and seem to think and emote (though I don't want to get all tangled up in a long-winded tangent trying to articulate the specifics of what I despise about other humans). I consider dog owners to be lacking in sufficient consciousness about how they insist on keeping canine prisoners for the selfish amusement of humans. If it were up to me, non human animals would no longer be kept on leashes or in cages by humans. I would permit all dogs to either live outside or to be painlessly euthanized (particularly the dogs which likely won't fare well). The bigger dogs can probably survive if humans leave food and water for them. Perhaps too many humans would complain about rampant dog poop, feral dogs mauling little kids, and dogs blocking traffic in the streets. Hence, I really advocate for euthanizing all the domesticated dogs and the abolishment of keeping animals confined to leashes or cages (unless transporting them to the hospital or for traveling long distances).

I think female humans are essentially dogs in human civilization (which, at least historically speaking, is fundamentally patriarchal (i.e. male centric and male led)). A woman without a male owner is (at least historically speaking) is not expected to fare well because she will be relegated to the streets and be forced to beg, resort to prostitution, and be vulnerable to dangerous conditions if not left to die. A man is generally treated as self-owning, self-sovereign, and a lot more able bodied and able minded (which means life for him is not expected to be nearly as difficult as it would be for a woman).

I have written extensively about my motivations to take on a masculine-androgynous gender identity and why I intend to stay on testosterone for the remainder of my life in past blog posts. In a relatively recent blog post, I said that I am rejecting womanhood and taking testosterone injections as a means to look, feel, sound, and think more like a man (and to be as physically strong as a man). I wrote in that blog post that I see no value in being a woman and went so far as to insinuate that womanhood should be made obsolete. If all women took male level testosterone and all human procreation was outsourced to machines, I think society would be very egalitarian and happier (but right now I think the patriarchy is still firmly in place and has women brainwashed into feeling trapped and obligated into being bitch slaves to men; as devoid of self-sovereignty and intrinsic self worth as domesticated dogs). Otherwise, women would not want to exhibit feminine attributes such as kid voice, swollen mammary glands, fragile bones, underdeveloped muscles, underdeveloped mathematical and spatial reasoning, excessive subcutaneous fat, and lethargy. Many of the most insecure cisgendered men might as well commit suicide over no longer having cisgendered women at their disposal. Good riddance! That would be an example of Darwinian natural selection weeding out those who can adapt to modern circumstances from those who cannot.

Honestly, I think male-to-female transsexuals are trying to get female privilege through the instrument of the patriarchy. In other words, I think MTFs are opportunists exploiting chauvinism the same basic way cisgendered female prostitutes would. Meanwhile, I consider FTM transsexuals (taking hormones) to be acquiring absolute power they would not otherwise have (and such power is evident in the wilderness where brute strength is a survival advantage).

* * *

By being an FTM transsexual, I do not consider myself to be siding with the patriarchy (and what I consider to be the patriarchy is cultural and civilization reinforcement and normalization of males subjugating females). 

Note that the ideas I express in my blog are mainly for catharsis and not necessarily meant to be interpreted as instructions for how to change the world. I do not mean to demand that all domesticated dogs be rendered extinct through mass euthanasia. I also do not mean to eradicate female secondary sexual characteristics in all humans. What I mean to express is the discomfort I feel about the existence of people who are forced to be effeminate against their will (and I cannot help but imagine that, deep down, all women secretly wish to be masculine-androgynous instead of feminine and to have the biological advantages males have in terms of strength, stamina, mental prowess, and not having to look so neonatal and so eeoticized as a consequence of sexual selection of such traits and cultural reinforcement of such traits). Now that modern means exist to imbue biological women with many of the essential secondary sexual characteristics of biological men, women could effectively renounce femininity and operate as sterile men. (Note that a biological woman who takes testosterone consistently for over a month consistently and continues to do so afterwards is not able to get pregnant). I have a copper intrauterine device implanted in my uterus for extra protection.

In the past (back before I went to college for the first time), I thought that the only way for me to pass for male would be to keep my body super lean by hardly eating more than I needed to sustain my body and whatever physical and mental activity I did. Then I went online and was surprised to see how a human who is biologically female could grow facial hair and develop muscalature and body fat distribution which is very convincinlgy manly (and what I though only biological men were capable of). Also, I was surprised to see how much a biological female could permanently alter its voice through taking testosterone such that its voice ended up sounding as low pitched as that of an adult male. I found those things out in late 2008 and started taking testosterone under a phycisian's guidance and with approval from mental health professionals at a clinic in San Francisco for queer youths. 

I have been criticized many times in recent months over how vain I am for taking testosterone seemingly only to prevent myself from accumulating fat stores and for having a leaner physieue with much less effort and without having to go on a diet without such steroids. I am not going to compete professionally in any athletic challenges nor bother changing my legal name nor legal gender (but I probably will sign up for some kind of 5K race for fun one of these days and run in it just to have a good time and get free t-shirts and beer at the end). The people who gave me the most criticism for taking steroids were cisgendered heterosexual men who seem to think that I am mutiliating my body and getting rid of what those guys think makes me worth their time to pay attention to. Also, I do think they are legitimatley threatened that I will be able to seriously compete with them in all domains considered to be traditionally masculine. I do not think they want me to outperform them at such endeavors. Hence, any opposition I have received seems to be solely to protect the fragile patriachal male ego from feeling usurpeded by a biological female.

This was a bit awkward for me to write (but so has been many other posts I have written and published online for a global audience). I am no stranger to being awkward in public and doing things which I think are embarassing. I do not really care that much about making a spectacle and circus freak of myself in public. <span span style="background:#ffff00">All I really care about is maximizing my freedom and being successful in the endeavors I set out to do. That's it. Nothing else really matters much to me (though I do worry about the long term survival of humanity, environmental preservation, promoting culturally progressive ideals, and abolishing slavery (because, it is voluntary, it is volunteerism), forced torture (because, if it is voluntary, it is BDSM), forced poverty (because, if it is voluntary, it is bohemianism), forced illiteracy (because, if it is voluntary, it is a regressive lifestyle), and medical negligence (because, if it is voluntary, it is bodily autonomy).</span>

Well, I would like to move on with my blog and hopefully not keep bringing up sexual politics and other banal and petty subject matter again. Perhaps I will clear my mind by binge reading the news. Then, later on after I feel mentally refreshed from the dreary old subjects I have addressed in this entire blog, I plan on getting back to work on rennovating my primary website. (I hear people frequently honk and make loud vocal interjections seemingly in response to me thinking certain thoughts as though I am being heavily surveilled and pressurized by other people in my midst who are eager to make me feel smothered, oppressed, and unable to switch mental gears. I am in great dread over the idea that other people are stalking, surveiling, and interfering with me in order to prevent me from moving on with my life and keeping me trapped in perpetual fighting over petty subject matter because that is all those people seem able to handle).
