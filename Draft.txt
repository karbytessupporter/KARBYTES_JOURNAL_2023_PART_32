Before I went downtown to buy some groceries and coffee, I was lamenting over the fact that, if I can only save $10 per week, it would take me until November 2023 to save up approximately $200. After I did my shopping, I was relieved to see that I was able to effortlessly save $7 and not feel deprived of what I looked forward to buying and consuming. I checked my expected expenses (which are enumerated in journal entry # X of the year 2023) and saw that my total annual membership fees amount to approximately $250 (rounded up, of course).

I saw an old lady walk by with her golden retriever on a leash and thought they both looked happy. Earlier I saw a rottweiler sitting in a parked van staring out the open door. I thought to myself about how dogs have been domesticated by humans to be helpful and extremely loyal to humans and, in some cases, helplessly dependent on humans for survival. I cannot comfortably as I did prior to the year 2016 justify owning a dog. After my cannabis-induced period of "awakening" in early 2016, my sensibilities have changed. Within the past year (and especially within the past six months) I have become a lot more solidified in what my ontological and ethical precepts are. I am not as approving of how humans conduct themselves as I used to be prior to 2016. Instead, I am much more openly critical and shunning of other people than I used to be based on how they conduct themselves and seem to think and emote (though I don't want to get all tangled up in a long-winded tangent trying to articulate the specifics of what I despise about other humans). I consider dog owners to be lacking in sufficient consciousness about how they insist on keeping canine prisoners for the selfish amusement of humans. If it were up to me, non human animals would no longer be kept on leashes or in cages by humans. I would permit all dogs to either live outside or to be painlessly euthanized (particularly the dogs which likely won't fare well). The bigger dogs can probably survive if humans leave food and water for them. Perhaps too many humans would complain about rampant dog poop, feral dogs mauling little kids, and dogs blocking traffic in the streets. Hence, I really advocate for euthanizing all the domesticated dogs and the abolishment of keeping animals confined to leashes or cages (unless transporting them to the hospital or for traveling long distances).

I think female humans are essentially dogs in human civilization (which, at least historically speaking, is fundamentally patriarchal (i.e. male centric and male led)). A woman without a male owner is (at least historically speaking) is not expected to fare well because she will be relegated to the streets and be forced to beg, resort to prostitution, and be vulnerable to dangerous conditions if not left to die. A man is generally treated as self-owning, self-sovereign, and a lot more able bodied and able minded (which means life for him is not expected to be nearly as difficult as it would be for a woman).

I have written extensively about my motivations to take on a masculine-androgynous gender identity and why I intend to stay on testosterone for the remainder of my life in past blog posts. In a relatively recent blog post, I said that I am rejecting womanhood and taking testosterone injections as a means to look, feel, sound, and think more like a man (and to be as physically strong as a man). I wrote in that blog post that I see no value in being a woman and went so far as to insinuate that womanhood should be made obsolete. If all women took male level testosterone and all human procreation was outsourced to machines, I think society would be very egalitarian and happier (but right now I think the patriarchy is still firmly in place and has women brainwashed into feeling trapped and obligated into being bitch slaves to men; as devoid of self-sovereignty and intrinsic self worth as domesticated dogs). Otherwise, women would not want to exhibit feminine attributes such as kid voice, swollen mammary glands, fragile bones, underdeveloped muscles, underdeveloped mathematical and spatial reasoning, excessive subcutaneous fat, and lethargy. Many of the most insecure cisgendered men might as well commit suicide over no longer having cisgendered women at their disposal. Good riddance! That would be an example of Darwinian natural selection weeding out those who can adapt to modern circumstances from those who cannot.

Honestly, I think male-to-female transsexuals are trying to get female privilege through the instrument of the patriarchy. In other words, I think MTFs are opportunists exploiting chauvinism the same basic way cisgendered female prostitutes would. Meanwhile, I consider FTM transsexuals (taking hormones) to be acquiring absolute power they would not otherwise have (and such power is evident in the wilderness where brute strength is a survival advantage).
