This morning I took a picture of the hills near where I was sleeping at last night at approximately 6:20AM on 02_JULY_2023. Then I uploaded that image to my Instagram and GitHub accounts.

Last night I relaxed beneath a sky full of stars and a full moon watching an interesting and informative video I downloaded (X) about the future of the Internet and how artificial intelligences like chatGPT are expected to shape it.

Before I proceed, I would like the audience of this web page to know that, seemingly whenever I try to announce my personal development goals pertaining to having a more positive attitude, other people are quick to interject with discouraging and snarky vocalizations such that I feel engulfed, alarmed, depressed, and forced to be angrier and more hateful towards humanity than I really want to be. 

I would like to redress what I said in my previous blog post about thinking women are uglier than men. I think most men are at least as ugly as are most women. I just think men are almost always more beautiful looking to me than are women because I think women try too hard to look beautiful and I think they make ugly faces and wear ugly clothes, cosmetics, hairstyles, and poses to do so. I think the women who are not overweight and who get out and engage in regular outdoor activity (and not just going to the gym) are most attractive because they are doing more than working on their fitness and trying to grab attention for it; they are also, like me, making a priority of spending time in natural settings and getting some much needed respite from the cloistering stress-inducing man-made urbane environments which implicitly discourage frugality, being in touch with the natural world beyond the anthropocene, and mindfulness which makes good physical and mental health possible (because poor physical and mental health is good for businesses which profit on people having perpetual health issues to mitigate).

I do not find very many humans to be attractive nor likeable these days (and that is mainly because I have gotten the impression that they frequently go out of their way to harass me and to pick fights with me when I would rather just be left alone and not fight with people). I think too many humans are addicted to using me as a distraction from attending to whatever their personal responsibilities and dilemmas are and, also, I think the society I live in oppressively coerces people into normalizing and reinforcing pettiness, laziness, anti-intellectualism, fake and exaggerated emotions, and blatant disregard for environmental issues and the well being of non human animals.

Anyway, I hope this note finds you well. (That last sentence is a silly phrase I've heard other people use in emails which I think is supposed to sound friendly and formal).
