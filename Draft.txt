Perhaps my least favorite voice which harasses me through "technological telepathy" is what sounds like a high pitched adult female human's voice speaking in a nonchalant, breathy, and sing-song tone (which is sometimes whispering) which also sounds depressed and irritable while emitting verbal phrases which are almost always snarky and sarcastic put-downs expressing discontent at the fact that I am not spending more time in the presence of other humans and, also, expressing discontent over the fact that I fact that I do not seem to be more worried about money. 

The thought police which perpetuate the pervasive electronic harassment I described in the previous paragraph seem to be getting away with violating my First Amendment right by interfering with my personal religion (which is non-violent and non-intrusive towards humans other than myself), interrupting my thoughts, and interjecting their own words into my thought stream which seem oppositional to the goals I have which pertain to my personal religion. To be succinct, I think I am being severely mistreated (and to make matters worse for me, I have observed behavior from other civilians which suggests that the vast majority of humans are either indifferent to the fact that I feel severely mistreated in the manner I described or else those humans condone such mistreatment and are acting as "civilian cops" who go out of their way to perpetuate such mistreatment towards me).

A complaint I hear frequently through such harassment is that I am "too self focused". I disagree that I am "too self focused" because my personal religion is about spending a lot more time in solitude than I think most humans are used to and condone. I think people are generally strongly opposed to my implented preference to spend what they think is excessive time alone doing things which do not seem to detract from other humans' lives such as developing open source software applications and meditating because my engaging in those solitary endeavors provoke those people's insecurities about not being very far along in their own personal endeavors for reasons such as having scant free time (especially time in solitude) to pursue such endeavors and not apparently having as many desirable accommodations as what I have (and what I seem to have which those other people do not have is house to live in rent-free which is located in a safe and scenic part of the San Francisco Bay Area east bay region bordering expansive regional parks which provide me accessible respite from urban and suburban environments and money from parents which is sufficient to allow me to live relatively comfortably while practicing my religion whose values are environmental sustainability, authentic self expression, personal development, and studying STEM related subject matter (and STEM is an acronym for Science Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)).

People seem to be implying that I am not doing enough to serve other people. I think I am doing enough to serve other people by minimizing my harmful ecological impact, keeping to myself instead of involving myself in other people's business, and focusing on building my skills and knowledge and doing things which I think are constructive rather than corrosive to my well being or to other people's well being. 

The people who seem opposed to how I currently live seem to dismiss how little my activities negatively interfere with other people's lives. The people who seem opposed to how I currently live seem to be jealous and insecure tyrants (or loyalists to such) who want to eliminate what they think is competition to their ability to be socially influential and admired by those they indoctrinate and subordinate. It is what I deem to be typical alpha male behavior: territorialism and monopolization of scarce resources for the sake of ensuring that only some people's genes and memes continue to proliferate. I would even go so far as to suggest that most of the social, economic, and environmental injustices which humans are most plagued by and complain about are fundamentally symptoms of male apes trying to protect their egos from feeling diminished by what they see as competition. I think such tyranny reinforced rather extreme sexual dimorphism in humans which favored women being significantly weaker than men (because such a configuration forced women to have to defer to men who used physical coercion to get his way).
