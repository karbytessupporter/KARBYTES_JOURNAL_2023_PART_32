For the record, I am effectively homeless. Even though I have a legal address which I am apparently allowed to live at rent free (and that house belongs to my parents), I almost never spend the night there and, instead, spend the night outside camping in various locations. I've been doing that for the past 3+ years. I do it because it seems to be the only way I can cheaply live on my own (or at least approximate living on my own). During that time I have steadily been depending on my mom for a daily allowance of at least $40 for food and other expenses. During that I was mostly unemployed and only employed for no more than four months at a time at various restaurant and warehouse jobs. What I want but have not been able to get is a place to live without having to share living quarters with other people, an electric car which I own, a job in which I don't feel forced to put up with people I don't enjoy being in the presence of, and freedom from being forced to listen to propaganda from literal thought police. I am afraid I will spend the rest of my life feeling severely deprived of what I currently feel I need to be happy instead of chronically miserable. I am also worried that my severe anxiety and anger and self righteous thoughts upset other people to the extent that those other people want me evicted from my home, incarcerated in a mental hospital for failure to assimilate to the other people's culture and lifestyle, or placed in a forced marriage or custodial relationship with someone who acts as my owner and dictator (and the last thing already seems to be the case). 

I honestly feel that I am "not allowed to" set and achieve many if not all of the goals I set for myself because other people are disapproving of me having that degree of control over my own life (and time especially). Nevertheless, I have been making progress towards completing the final revision of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com (which I promised to complete no later than 01_AUGUST_2023 though I am now trying to "rush to the finish line" within less than two days from now).
