When I walked home today around noon, I saw the garage door was open and my dad was packing away his drum set while Steve watched (and I thought I heard Steve say "Shut your mouth"). I grabbed my charged electronics, put them in my bag, and left. Several hours I came back. I thought my dad would be gone for longer. He seemed to stay out only to fool me into thinking that I would be able to enjoy the house without his unnerving presence and also, to make me beg for him to unpack the drums which he probably still has packed in his car. I have not gone inside. I just smelled his cigarette smoke, heard him cough, and saw him standing by the kitchen sink through the sliding glass door from my vantage in the backyard. Every day since 28_JUNE_2023, I have noticed my father seeming to be extra hostile towards me being at this property like he wants to make me feel bullied off the premises so that I am forced to live on the streets and rush to take a low wage job. I think he is opposed to me getting a job which would pay me more and utilize my IT skills, passion, and prior job experience.
