"Get a job so you don't take up so much space in public. Get a job so you have someone other than yourself to focus on," said one of my critics. I responded by saying, "Being self focused (even to the extent of being a schizoid) is not a crime." The critic responded by saying, "Yes it is. People will have you committed to a mental hospital, evict you from your home, or bully you if you refuse to get a job so that you aren't a free loader with enough time on its hands to get into mischief. You make other people feel uncomfortable if they see you not participating more in society and interacting with other people because humans are hardwired and socially conditioned to be social creatures. It's pathological for you to not want to participate in human society and to socialize. That's why we are instigating this intervention and issuing this ultimatum. Go home and stop spending so much time outdoors. Look for a job immediately. Drive or have someone drive you to your job and interviews. Stop loitering in public and spending so much time outdoors. It's disturbing to the general public."

I noticed that random people follow me around in public and stand by intently watching me in many of the places I frequent seemingly as a means to pressure me to go indoors or where people can keep a closer watch over me.

I suspect that some people are worried that I'm going to harm myself or others simply because I express rather dark and controversial thoughts online and am alone almost all the time. Those people seem to be threatened by how little attention, approval, and guidance I seem to need from other people and chastise me as being arrogant, vain, and aloof to the existence of others and insufficiently willing to cater to their needs. I think most humans are too needy and too dependent on other people and are missing out what I consider to be essential to my happiness: the well founded and experience backed belief that I am unconditionally alone and hence that I am the only constant in my life. Other people appear and dissappear in my field of awareness (and my sense of occupying a rigid and finite piece of space and time also fades in and out of my awareness through sleep, dreams, and drug induced states of altered consciousness). Some people think my solipsistic worldview is dangerous or, at the very least, annoying for them to put up with. "Hello! We're here! We're not just figments of your imagination you self absorbed and immature baby. Stop treating us like we don't exist," I imagine some of my critics saying. I nevertheless cannot help but treat them like "non playable characters" in my reality whom I can never know for sure are conscious or have agency but for the sake of not taking damage and for the sake of not getting kicked out of this level of reality or imprisoned in this level of reality, I do what I think is necessary to prevent those "NPCs" from obstructing my autonomy.

This is not a very high quality note. I just felt the need to add it to this website because (a) I am interested in and enjoy operating by a solipsistic worldview and (b) I see little to praise about most people (but I do have special favoritism towards people who support and share my interests in science and technology without demanding I have a personality). I enjoy and aspire to be robot-like rather than animal-like. I think that there is no need to give birth to any more humans because each human could technically extend its lifespan for an indefinitely long period of time (and I would rather prioritize who is currently alive than prioritize who is yet to be born). Most of human behavior which I find abhorrent seems to be about sexual reproduction and prostitution. I would rather devote my life to promoting self reliance (and humans collaborating with machine intelligence) and ecological sustainability which isn't half hearted than settle for accommodating the masses who seem too immature and anthropcentric and dogmatic and controlling for me to genuinely admire. Bad things could happen to anyone and not necessarily out of retribution. Nature provides an abundance of examples of how prevalent suffering and violence is. To me, all biodiversity is fundamentally the same timeless algorithm called "survival of the fittest" (or, to be technical, the first to monopolize scarce resources or to avoid dying before passing on one's genes and memes).

Like I said, this is not what I would consider to be a high quality note. That's because it seems to be a bit drama mongering. I prefer to keep my content relatively dry, boring, and drama free (but that's not what most humans seem to prefer). I do worry that other people are trying to keep me from exiting fight or flight mode because such people are addicted to drama and using me as a source of it. I would like to move on from this note and focus on other things.

(At the time of this writing I noticed one of my two water bottles is missing. I also have been bullied by the thought police who seem to enjoy watching me feel intruded upon, not having my ideas valued by other people, and having my things stolen or lost. They keep saying I'm not allowed to be alone and that I'm forced to be in an abusive relationship and the civilians around me seem to condone that be the case. Apparently many people want me to feel abused, violated, miserable, and undignified and almost no people seem to take my side in this war. I get the sense that most people just want to get rid of me for their convenience and that they don't mind if my mind and body atrophies while left in some kind of prison. It seems like many people think I deserve to be punished and tortured for not being more socially conformist).

"We just didn't want you to look so upwardly mobile. We want you to stop talking to yourself. We are lying in wait hoping and expecting you do something which makes people call 911 on you so we can put you away for a while. We're sick of you doing nothing but computer science. We're sick of you being all about school. Get a job. Give people a break from you being in your own world. Let your father enjoy his house without you having to be star of your own show. Get a boyfriend and shave your legs. Stop taking yourself so seriously. Get a sense of humor. Stop being so high strung. Stop being so pretentious. Don't be such an Apple snob. Don't be such an ablist bully. Stop taking so much time off. You just need to do what everyone else does and get a job. You're not allowed to leave until you finish saying goodbye to everyone. Stop acting like you're about to run away or we'll try to stop you."
