<span style="background:#ffff00">I was reminded today that, in the game I am playing, it is very easy to get distracted because there are so many distractions within this game. At the same time, I understand that if I am too hermetically sealed off from "randomness", my results within this game (which is about optimizing my use of resources in order to produce digital content which is as pleasing to karbytes as possible) will not be as high quality because they would be lacking a sense of there being a world beyond karbytes' existence and karbytes being a part of something larger and more complex than karbytes.</span>

Also today, I decided to charge my electronics at the electrical outlets which were part of business real estate instead of government real estate because I did not want to be too dependent on the government for resources needed to work on my personal website enterprise. Related to that thought is the idea that the government deliberately is stingy when it comes to food stamps and other "free" (i.e. tax funded) social services which help poor people get their basic needs met because, it the government provided enough money and economic support to poor people such that those people could subsist comfortably on just that support instead of from money earned from working in service of the general public, then those poor people would have too little of an incentive to be more financially self sufficient and involved in serving people other than themselves (and in helping to create and sustain a society which is robust and interesting instead of dilipidated from a lack of people being interested in the world outside of their own households). I was thinking today that I might as well think of karbytes as a business entity who would not survive outside the context of modern capitalism because the essence of what karbytes is is heavily dependent on globalism, Silicon Valley culture, and collaborative scientific and technological advancements. More than anything, karbytes is extremely dependent on the World Wide Web (and the Internet which substantiates it) the way a fish is dependent on the water it lives inside of to survive and thrive. Without the World Wide Web, there would be no karbytes. In order for Kar to be considered by karbytes to be cool instead of lame, Kar needs to be a small business of its own (i.e. a buyer and a seller or distributor or quality insurance inspector of creator of sellable goods and services) and not just a recipient of sellable goods and services. Hence, in addition to looking for a (paid) job in order to earn an income, Kar also intends to look for a (paid) job which enables Kar to be a better small business of its own (even if that means that what Kar ultimately "sells" is open source software whose creation and marketing is entirely paid for by Kar's money earned from working for some employer other than Kar).

(By the way, in the Instagram screenshot below, I did mean to imply that I think that white people (i.e. humans of primarily or entirely European decent) generally look less like non-human primates than do seemingly most (if not all) other human races. To me white people look more like aliens than apes).
