There is a person (and I suspect that it might be AJP) who has been using "technological telepathy" since approximately 13_FEBRUARY_2019 to forcibly communicate with me and to surveil my thoughts with the intent of trying to manipulate my thoughts and behavior into becoming what that person wants me to be (and I suspect that other people (my family members included) are "secretly" trying to help that person achieve his goal in covertly coercing me into being his partner, slave, or scapegoat). 

I think that the person (and the many people who seem to be on that person's side and against me) are impatient to get me to finish the finalization of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com (or even to abandon the project) in order to appease that person. "Hurry up and finish being so self centered and focused on your project so that I can talk to you for real," seems to be what that person is essentially saying. In the web page named X I promised my imaginary colleague C that I would finish the finalization of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com no later than 01_AUGUST_2023. (The reason why I am taking that long (and too long according to that person) is that I want to ensure that (a) the process of finalizing Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com is as magical and enjoyable of an experience as possible and something I will fondly look back on for the rest of my life and (b) the final product is as flawless and high quality as possible. Apparently, I am being "criminally selfish" for wanting to achieve those aims instead of treating that person as a higher priority).

For the record, I intend to remain single for the remainder of my life even though other people seem to object to my being single. "You only have yourself to worry about," is something I have heard that person and others say to me. I do worry about the entire ecosystem of Planet Earth to some extent but it is true that I care about myself more than I care about seemingly any other entity (and that self-centeredness is not something I think is unethical nor something I wish to change). I think other people insist on using coercive and punitive tactics to get me to be less self centered and I object to such meddling.

Finally, this journal entry web page is the second to last journal entry web page in this blogging chapter. The next journal entry web page after this (and final journal entry web page to include in its this chapter) will be an announcement of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com's finalization.
