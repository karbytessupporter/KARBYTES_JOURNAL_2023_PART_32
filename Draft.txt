Earlier today while eating my lunch in a nice patch of dirt behind some buildings in the downtown area, I was reading some posts on Quora about "schizoid personality disorder" and found some information from several people which made me even more seriously convinced that I have legitimately become a schizoid over the past five to ten years. I read that it's not as much an innate pattern as it is a learned adaptation to stressful events in one's early life. A schizoid basically does not look outside itself for comfort and fulfillment and tends to be asexual (which seems to be a major issue of contention for those claiming to be schizoids and getting heckled by acquaintances for the schizoid's lack of interest in having sex or in finding a romantic partner (because such acquisitions seem to be very central to mainstream notions of human life)). I could identify with also feeling asexual and preferring to be alone doing my own thing almost 100% of the time in addition to other enumerated schizoid characteristics: wearing headphones even without sounds playing through them as a means to ward off being talked to by other people, generally not expressing anger unless one is cut off from one's own self, tending to be very content to live alone in relative social isolation while immersed in introverted and cerebral pastimes such as playing video games, philosophy, and programming, and tending to act as though negotiating with other people is not an option for them. 

I would like to, for now on, make this blog and everything else I publish online targeted especially towards and in promotion of schizoids and people with autism or Asperger's Syndrome while ignoring pretty much everyone else. (I forgot to mention that one of the "symptoms" other people commonly attribute to being a schizoid is feeling like they are aliens from a different planet packaged in human form going through the motions of pretending to think and feel like normal humans from Planet Earth. I can definitely relate to feeling something other than human (and liking it)). Perhaps the most important core "tenet" in being a schizoid is extreme self reliance and socializing only as minimally as necessary to get one's needs met. I admit that being a schizoid seems very selfish and ungenerous towards human civilization as a whole, but in my (educated) opinion, schizoids tend to be less intrusive towards other people, more intelligent and thoughtful, and less animalistic (and more robotic). I think every human is fundamentally motivated by selfish intent. Schizoids are just more direct about it. I think the world would be a happier and more civil place if all people were schizoid. I don't expect schizoids to ever become the majority of the human population. I do appreciate the fact that there is neural diversity amongst the human population (though, to be a bit more honest, I don't see much value in not being a schizoid because non schizoids seem to exist merely to be exhibitionist drama mongering entertainers who keep humanitarians and emergency responders busy).
