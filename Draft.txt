Update: I have reason to believe that my father has been trying to pick fights with me and to make me feel deprived of a place to sit down and not be physically intruded upon. He seems to tell lies quite often and pretend not to be able to mentally process things (presumably so that he gets to be treated like an innocent little kid rather). I think he has stolen some of my belongings including mail. He has acted angry and sullen whenever I seem happy and he seems happiest when I feel ambushed and disrespected. He does things I'm sure he knows I don't like such as smoke cigarettes in his house and try to get me to stop when I'm walking to get in the passenger seat of his car and offer me eggs even though I've been a vegan for years. He seems to do nothing with his life but wait for drama to unfold while claiming to be minding his own business. I could go into more detail and enumerate many examples of what I presume is my dad being a bully and drama monger but I decided to stop here and say that I thought about making up some violent offense which my dad committed against me in order to have him handcuffed and sent to prison but I would rather not make life for anyone harder than it has to be. I'm hoping that people who read this note will be able to read through the lines and see that I'm not really at odds with anyone other than less than five people who I think have been trying to make me miserable for years. I figure that such people suffer enough from the natural consequences of their behavior. Just because they are miserable and seemingly unwilling to change their behavior for the better does not mean I should have to settle for being just as miserable and lacking in self discipline as they are. It's not my responsibility to be those people's care taker or life coach or scapegoat.
