C: "I noticed that you are taking what seems to be an unnecessarily long time to finish finalizing each of the web pages which are currently part of your primary website. Is it because you do not want to finish?"

karbytes: "Short answer: yes. Long answer: I do want to get each of those web pages finalized (including the home page) because doing so means I can say my soul's home is finally complete and ready to be lived in, preserved, and verbatim copied over into universes other than the one we are having this conversation right now on the day of 25_JUNE_2023."

C: "What do you plan on doing after you finalize each web page on Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com?"

karbytes: "I cannot say with certainty that the home page of that website will ever be what I consider to be finalized (but because I plan to take at least a year long break from adding new pages to that website, I feel obliged to say that the website is in its finalized state so that the transuniversal digital archivists don't get mad at me and say that I can't put the source code of that website into the time capsule which is being sent through a wormhole or other special metaphysical portal which transports digital information from the universe in which this blog post was originally written to some other universe). I feel obliged to hurry up and say that Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com is seriously done being updated by 01_AUGUST_2023 so that my most cherished intellectual property has a chance of being saved and transmitted to the alternate universes."

C: "I need an absolutist unambiguous answer from you: do you seriously intend to get that entire website finalized by 01_AUGUST_2023?"

karbytes: "Yes."

C: "Good to know! I'll notify the administrators of the transuniversal digital archivists team that your source code will be ready to be added to their time capsule by that date. Now we can move onto the next question: what do you plan to do with your life after 01_AUGUST_2023?"

karbytes: "After I'm done finalizing the entirety of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com (which I promise will happen before 01_AUGUST_2023), I plan to add code files to various public GitHub repositories such as X and save each raw code file (which has its own unique web page address) which I add to those repositories to the WayBack Machine. I will probably have some kind of web page indexed on the home page of this website (i.e. Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) which highlights such GitHub file links and not include any rich text software development tutorials in that new subdirectory of this website. At that point, my readers should have everything they need to get started on software development using Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com as a starter pack for making use of that future subdirectory of raw GitHub files pertaining to more advanced software development topics than what is featured in the starter pack website."

C: "Cool. It sounds like, if you stick to your plan, you won't be inconveniencing the transuniversal digital archivist team. They don't want to have to keep adding your stuff to their already very crowded payload space. You are only allowed to contribute one zip file per lifetime to the transuniversal digital archive team's digital transports. Every person gets to upload no more than one zip file to the transuniversal digital archives in that person's lifetime (and the size of that zip file cannot exceed a certain number of gigabytes)."

karbytes: "Good to know. Is there anything else you would like to ask me?"

C: "No. I look forward to receiving the zip file containing the source code and media files which comprise the finalized version of your primary website no later than 01_AUGUST_2023."
