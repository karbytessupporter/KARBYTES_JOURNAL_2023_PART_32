I am quite pleased with the state of the web page of my primary website named EULERS_NUMBER_APPROXIMATION. What I like about that code tutorial web page in particular is how it clearly explains and illustrates (physically and logically) how to approximate Euler's Number by adding N reciprocals of i factorial where i is a unique nonnegative integer no larger than (N - 1) and N is a natural number. By the term "physically", I am referring to the way the C++ app explains what a pointer is and how contiguous memory cells in the computer's random access memory are dynamically allocated to storing those N factorial values (and the program outputs the memory addresses of each of the N elements of that array). By the term "logically", I am referring to the arithmetic steps involved in generating an approximation of Euler's Number and how that approximation cannot be achieved using a finite number of additive terms (but the larger N is, the more closely the sum of the N terms approximates Euler's Number). 

At the moment I am not sure whether or not to change the ordering of some web pages which are listed on the home page of my primary website or whether or not to remove some of those pages. I don't like how the current version of the web page named EXPONENTIATION relies on "black box" functions which are defined in the cmath library; namely log() and exp(). I asked chatGPT to help me write the C++ program featured in that web page. I would like to write my own version of log() and exp() and not rely on cmath at all but doing so will take more time than simply using the cmath functions exp() and log(). For that reason, I am considering making the web page named NATURE the next web page after EULERS_NUMBER_APPROXIMATION on the home page of my primary website.
