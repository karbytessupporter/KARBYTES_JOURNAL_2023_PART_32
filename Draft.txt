I'm tired of hearing other people's chimp-like voices which are caustic, ugly, and intrusive and incessantly chattering.

I'm tired of looking at people's ugly primate faces which demand too much of my attention and which they forcefully shove into my viewport.

I'm tired of inhaling people's toxic air pollution and facing the prospects of a shorter and shittier life as a result.

I'm sick of putting up with the slovenly behavior of brown and black people in particular who take more than they give. Such people are immature, slovenly, unintelligent, and parasitic.

The women of such an ilk frequently come across as bloated and garish clowns which have tiny whimpering voices which seems incongruous with their massive bodies (and atop their disproportionately tiny heads are buns comprised of hair tightly pulled or otherwise curtains framing their grotesque faces). 

Such people seem so contagiously downtrodden, sulky, trivial and unoriginal in their quality of thoughts, rude, small-minded, self-righteous, belligerent, animalistic, and addicted to picking fights over petty matters.

If I could get away with it, I would have many of such people sterilized if not instantaneously vaporized. People like them hog resources and impede humanity's evolutionary progress.

Many humans I come across seem to lack spacial awareness and are pathetically oblivious to their surroundings and apathetic about anything which takes place outside of an extremely small scope of concern. 

The thoughts of so many people seem to horrifically shallow, unoriginal, reflexive, flippant, and lazy.
