As I was walking up the hill, I noticed a big car parked on the opposite side of the road with its headlights on and seemingly idling for what looked like at least a minute. As I walked closer to where that car was parked, I noticed two or three kids between ages 5 and 12 emerge and one or two adults and they noisily ascended the staircase up to the porch where the front door was located. I noticed how loud and how many frivolous whooping and barking vocalizations those primates were making. (When I was a kid, I remember hardly making a sound and not making such caustic, loud, and frivolous vocalizations like so many kids and adults do today). I had a brief fantasy of blowing those kids' heads off with an assault rifle and excusing it as pest control). Then I had the following sweet reverie...

Suppose I was suddenly granted the following super powers:

(a) total invincibility to injury, illness, and being physically restrained or incapacitated.

(b) the ability to extend my life for as long as I voluntarily choose to and then to quickly and painlessly die by merely deciding that I am ready to die.

(c) being issued an unconditional personal income of $10,000 per month (from the government and particularly from the federal military budget)

(d) being immune from ever being legally criminalized and from ever being punished for any of my actions.

(e) able to murder any animal I want to using my thoughts by any means I imagine and desire for any reason and without any obstruction.

I would terrorize people into conforming to my wishes and obliterate people who I think are seriously detrimental to my agenda or people I randomly decide to obliterate just to make a statement that I am godlike in my authority, brutality, and power.

I cannot help but think of humans as stinky, obnoxious, ugly, and overrated parasitic animals who I want to treat some of like literal pigs just to make my point that humans deserve to be subject to the same barbaric circumstances they have the animals they eat go through until every human stops eating non human animals  entirely (but cultured meat which lacks a nervous system is okay by me for anyone to eat).

This is to counter anthropocentrism and humanity's widespread disregard towards the state of Earth's climate and environmental conditions and ecosystems.
