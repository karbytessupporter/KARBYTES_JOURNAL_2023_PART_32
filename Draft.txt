When most jobs are outsourced to robots and when each human adult is issued an unconditional fixed monthly income in the form of discretionary cash and housing vouchers, adult humans could also (a) optionally work at jobs where they are needed for additional income or without payment and (b) optionally attend some kind of ongoing special interest group meetups for a minimum of 4 hours per month (to help prevent humans from feeling more socially isolated than they want to).
