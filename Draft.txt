I had a fucked up thought:

I imagined that AJP wanted nothing more to do with me than to have a biological offspring using me as the womb provider and only caring about his child reaching age twelve and then practically disowning the child after that age. I put myself in AJP's shoes and imagined that, based on how simplistic his Twitter posts have been (because, as far as I can tell, they only seem to reiterate the fact that he is a software engineer and a straight white male living in Oakland who likes to drink alcohol) all AJP wants in life (besides to appreciate the coolness of math and software engineering and other things which he finds entertaining) is to experience the "power" of bringing a new conscious being into existence using his own DNA.

I do not think it is that remarkable to bring a new life into existence. In fact, I anticipate that page 6 of this website will be a directory of web pages if not a single web page containing my entire sequenced gemone (which will be licenced as public domain) so that any person can legally make copies of my gemone (whole or in part) for any purpose (including to make genetic clones of me in the form of live human beings whose genomes would be identical to mine). I do not see what is so remarkable about that. Nature is creative and I think all the things inside of nature which can be classified as phenomena instead of noumena is fundamentally reducible to a finite sequence of binary digits (because I think all matter is comrpised of particles which are each comprised of a finite amount of energy packed into a finite amount of space-time).

The latest tweet AJP made seems related to a thought I had recently when I was taking a shit or something (I do not remember the exact circumstances other than the fact that I was feeling excited by philosophical thoughts about the nature of existence and how everything seems reducible to digital information). 

My response to AJP's tweet (or perhaps just a "bumber sticker" thought which seems similar or relevant to his latest tweet (which is displayed in one the screenshots on this web page) is the following):

<em>physics / mathematics = computer_science</em>

Besides the fucked up thought, I updated the web page named PUBLIC_DOMAIN on my primary website and I am very pleased with that updated web page. I also published a new page on this website which is listed as the fifth page on the home page of this website named XYZ. Then I posted a link to XYZ on my Twitter, Minds, LinkedIn, and Patreon pages.

<strike>(I also could not help but publish that italicized statement as a tweet on my own Twitter page just to be cheeky).</strike> Never mind. I decided not to post something so "poetic" and relatively meaningless as that italicized quote. This entire blog post does a better job explaining what that italizized "bumper sticker" quote was intended by me to imply.

Also, I uploaded a video of a coyote howling to Instagram and to GitHub which I recorded within the past six hours.
