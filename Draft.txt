In honor of the Fourth of July (i.e. American Independence Day (or what I call it: Fireworks Day)), I decided to share the lyrics to one of my favorite songs of all time which pertains to someone getting their face and limbs blown off by explosives: One by Metallica. What I especially like about that song (besides the flawlessly good instrumentals) is the lyrics and how they tell the story of that explosion victim's life following the explosion in a way which feels like what that person would likely be saying out loud and turning into a piece of art if he had the physical means to (but if he had the means to, the story would merely be fiction or remembrance instead of the "in the moment" lyrical and description of his nightmarishly solipsistic and sensory deprived experience). 

Earlier today as I was about to walk into Stoneridge Mall to buy some coffee and to look at the many people walking around, sitting in the massage chairs, and selling things, I had the following (relevant) thoughts (which also pertain to the green highlighted paragraph in the previous journal entry web page): the real Karlina is conscious but basically now a brain in a vat hidden inside the body of Kar (like a passenger in a car) while karbytes (i.e. Karlina's boyfriend) is driving that Kar and doing all the talking for Kar. Meanwhile, Karlina is only able to think, feel, and communicate non-verbally yet still in a very abstract way which seems out of touch with Kar's sense of being oriented at some precise location inside of a space-time continuum which is a subset of a network of space-time continuums (and each individual person has its own unique and inevitably solipsistic space-time continuum which may include experiences of there being other persons inside of that person's universe). Karlina is too pristine and relatively limitless to instantiate in such a relatively limited form as Kar is (and karbytes is basically an intermediary between Kar and Karlina (where Kar is the most physical of those three entities and, therefore the most limited of those three entities and where Karlina is the least physical of those three entities and the hardest of those three entities to define in precise terms)).

(I could go on to suggest that, metaphorically speaking, Kar is to Jesus (The Son) as Karbytes is to God (The Father) as Karlina is to The Holy Spirit, but I think Christianity and most other religions are unnecessarily convoluted and out of touch with modern science and modern civilization).

Without further adooo, here are the lyrics to One by Metalica:
