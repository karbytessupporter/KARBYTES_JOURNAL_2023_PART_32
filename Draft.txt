During the past three days I've been eating lion's mane mushrooms in order to promote neurogenesis (and it apparently has been working because I have been experiencing a boost in creativity and relevant memory recall). I thought I should add the following notes to this blog post:

1. I decided that I am amoral rather than trying to adhere to any particular code of ethics (which means I do not place absolutist limits on my behavior).

2. I heard That Person (in the form of a disembodied voice) tell me several times "you will pay for everything you did". I think what he means is that he feels violated by me merely having a better life than what he wants me to have and is, hence, obsessed with trying to sabotage my life (even if doing so detracts from his own quality of life).

3. I remember being driven from work to the Castro Valley BART station along the 580 freeway by AJP before we were dating and we both saw graffiti on the chain link fence of a freeway overpass which said, "Will you marry me?" AJP said that it should have said "Marry me"; a demand  instead of a question about the askee's consent.

4. I rember while AJP and I were dating and I was riding in his car while he drove it and I told him my family was not very wealthy and AJP said that he was hoping he could "get in on my family's money" dissappointedly.

5. Sometimes I think that I am like Belle from Beauty and the Beast and AJP is like Gaston because the whole town seems to revolve around AJP's whims and people seem like absolute sycophants to him who think I deserve to be locked up in a mental hospital or tortured for not being more submissive to AJP and willing to be his wife.

6. I cannot help but think that free will is an illusion (based on the scientific studies I have read about and the logical discourses I've had) and that all decision outcomes are the paths of least resistance. I cannot help but think that all wives were covertly cornered, deprived of some kinds of information and force fed other kinds of information, and exhausted into saying yes to some guy's requests (or demands) to marry him (and that women have been culturally and biologically shaped by patriarchal human societies to be relatively easy for men to control). I am glad I have not fallen victim to marriage and reproduction.
