20_JUNE_2023: I wanted to make one last update to this web page by mentioning that I read some news article about a girl who was a student from Ukraine temporally staying in the United States to attend school who learned that her family's house in Ukraine got bombed and how, when she talked to other kids about it, those American kids commented that they were surprised that she was so calm and unemotional about it. I wanted to annotate this journal entry web page by suggesting that Americans seem to be excessively emotionally reactive and not sufficiently logical and calm for my taste. I can tell other people are desperately trying to prevent me from being as calm and as logical and as happy as I want to be. I can tell that there are people on a mission to force me to be chronically stressed out, emotionally reactive, histrionic, and short in attention span compared to what I want to be. So, when I said in the section below this section that retreating to nature gives me peace and joy, I meant to say only relative to what I otherwise experience (and I typically am almost always miserable when I feel engulfed by other people's or otherwise oppressed by them). To be clear, I am almost always miserable to some extent unless I am asleep having a pleasant dream like what I had last time I slept (and I seem to only have fun in my dreams these days whereas my waking life in recent years is almost always filled with a sense of impending doom, inescapable strife, a sense of always having to be in constant fight or flight and having to be in the midst of angry, impatient, and controlling people). Not everyone is an impatient, angry control freak but enough are enough of the time for me to have what some may describe as mild to moderate post traumatic stress disorder. I would not assign myself the label of any mental illness. What I would assign myself as having is too high of attention to detail and too active of a mind. The thoughts I prefer to think are "luxurious" in their  length and depth and information density. My thoughts are not just aimless surface level meanderings intended to merely pass the time while I wait for instructions from higher ups or for emergencies to force me out of passivity into life-saving action. I feel the need to keep my "over thinking" mind a secret (but the surveillance state makes it impossible for me to keep any of my thoughts and actions a secret). Hence, I disclose as much information about myself as I think I have to in order to paint a picture of what I am trying to do so that the public has a chance to read it, get some basic understanding of what I'm trying to accomplish, and so that I do not have to keep repeating the same disclosures. To close this note, the global issue which I am most concerned about is environmental sustainability. It's obviously not as sexy of a subject in the collective consciousness as is war, violence, poverty, and celebrity antics. That's probably why environmental sustainability issues are not that big of a priority in mainstream news outlets and in mainstream social media platforms. Perhaps humanity is doomed to suffer greatly if not go extinct due to continued widespread negligence about environmental sustainability issues. I'll do my best to earn my own admiration by being the best example of humanity I can be in the hopes that other people will be inspired to follow suit. I doubt many people will any time soon. I can tell many if not most people are addicted to perpetuating strife and conflict as a means to avoiding having to assess themselves and make revisions to their beliefs and behaviors which might be uncomfortable to implement. So rather than metaphorically bang my head against a wall in vain trying to get humanity to conform to my wishes, I'll just default to treating them like a bunch of antagonistic or indifferent peeves who cannot be reasoned with (until they calm down and grow some brain cells) while I "sneak" around and away from them to do the things which make me feel good about myself (even if I suffer all the while).
