I uploaded another picture of the region I've been camping at the last few days. The picture depicts the hills northeast of my neighborhood of legal residence in Castro Valley, California. The photograph was taken at approximately 7:00AM. The sky in that picture is overcast. The temperature of that scene is approximately 20 degrees Celsius. I am tentatively planning on going to Dublin, California within the next three days and making that my new camping spot because I've been bullied a lot in Castro Valley by people who seem to want to prevent me from living there and from working on my personal hobbies there. I would rather not deal with nor mention in this blog any more petty drama concerning such people. I would rather avoid confrontation and keep to myself and continue where I left off on my summer renovation of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com. Within the next three months I plan on getting a part time or full time hourly wage job (but I might get a job sooner or later than three months from now). Well, the temperature is dropping and the wind is picking up. Rain might be on the way. I better get moving and vacate the premises.
