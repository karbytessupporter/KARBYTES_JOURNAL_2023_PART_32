Update: As soon as I sat down in my yard to eat a snack and then observe the cats, I thought I heard some neighbors talking in a scolding manner to discourage me from enjoying myself outside. I seem to be living next to people who are opposed to me simply sitting and observing the world around me and having random thoughts in an unhurried manner. They act like I have to be shooed back indoors and prevented from enjoying my own backyard. It makes me imagine having robots shoot them all dead so that nicer, less controlling neighbors can move into fill their place. Wherever I go in Castro Valley to sit down and contemplate, other people almost always show up and honk their car horns or vocalize in a caustic manner several times per minute (but especially when I'm trying to focus my mind on something other than humans in my vicinity). I could be misinterpreting the sounds other people make as those people trying to discourage me from having thoughts other than what those people approve of, but I've noticed this type of phenomenon daily while in Castro Valley more so than in other places I've hung out in. I think Castro Valley is a very dogmatically communal and nuclear family oriented place. I noticed that women in this place hardly go outside their houses and cars without other people or dogs accompanying them and they almost never seem to be doing anything cerebral such as reading a book or using a laptop like the guys I've seen in coffee shops. It's like everyone in this town (unless they are very old) has to be constantly interacting with other people in close physical proximity at all times and constantly chatting. I wonder if residents of this town are trying to make me so uncomfortable that I leave the town.
