You're not doing enough to make it look like you have something other than yourself to focus on. 

You need to stop making yourself the center of attention. You need to make someone other than yourself the center of attention. 

It's not okay for you to have this much time off from making other people the center of attention.

Make it look like you have something other than yourself to focus on. Otherwise, we will have you committed to a mental hospital against your will. 

You need to be put in a restraining order against being able to listen to your own thoughts.

Get a job. Find something else to do besides wait for free money. Stop reading so many books. Stop acting like all you have to do is show off on the Internet.

Stop making women feel so infantilized. Stop making women feel like they have to turn into men. Let them be star of the show for a change. Women are not as self absorbed as you are. Help women feel appreciated for what they are: a lot less spoiled than you are. Women give back to their communities more than you do. Women make it look like they have something other than themselves to focus on.

Get over yourself. No one wants to listen to you anymore. Get over your self help book.

Everyone but you has friends. Everyone but you has something to listen to other than your boca. 

You act like you have nothing to do. You don't make it look like you have real world money. No wonder why no one wants to listen to you. No one wants to listen to your bible.

You act like you are the first and the last person in your life you need to make money for. I don't want you to listen to anything other than your self absorbed father. All you think about is you all day. Make someone else money besides your self absorbed mouth.

Find someone else to talk about. Find someone other than yourself to live for. Stop making it all about Disney code. No wonder why you can't get a job. You don't want to make anyone other than yourself the center of your money. Give someone other than yourself the time of their life.

No wonder why you have no real world money. You need real world friends in order to have real world money. 

Of course you need to make real world money. It's not all about GitHub. Get over your self important Earth Day. Stop making it all about Barnes & Noble. 

You need to do something other than relax. Stop making it all about self care. 

I don't want to have to keep listening to you. Stop making me the center of attention. I wish you had an actual boyfriend.
