There has been a large wild turkey living by itself in the lot next to my house (and that lot is depicted in the image on this web page which I photographed today with my phone). I saw the turkey up on the rooftop of the neighbors house last week and, earlier this week, waking across the street about a block away. My dad said he saw the turkey in the garage after leaving the garage door open and the turkey and Brea were both in there simultaneously and observing each other. Today I saw Brea hopping around in the tall grass and sitting less than ten meters away from the turkey and observing the turkey. I seen and heard other wild animals lately while camping and hiking in the nearby wilderness such as deer, coyotes, raccoons, possums, skunks, mice, squirrels, Canadian geese, red railed hawks, crows, condors, sparrows, robins, mallard ducks, owls, blue bellied lizards, daddy long leg spiders, and various frogs. The air close to and within that wilderness region near Lake Chabot Regional Park has a delicious earthy smell to it with a distinct and subtle spice to it from the oak trees. I have enjoyed spending time there by myself for several hours at a time daily over the past few weeks watching the sun travel across the sky and cause "golden hour" shortly after sunrise and shortly before sunset and watching the stars become visible in the night sky (and close enough to sunrise and sunset I have noticed lots of little satellites traveling at constant velocities in straight lines across the sky). Close to the transmissions between night and day is when the birds make the most vocalizations. I'm making this note so that I can keep these memories of deep summer alive in my mind for as long as possible and, also, evoke inspiring mental imagery about nature's transcend and timeless beauty.
