Earlier today I heard the thought police say that they did not want to support me writing a book. This afternoon they said, "You look like a science major who isn't allowed to be anything but an abuse victim. You look like all you wanna be is an abuse victim." I asked them if this is a case of, "Don't cry or we will give you something to cry about," and they said yes and, "We decided you can't do anything but procrastinate. We didn't expect you to get very far anyway. We decided you can only handle being an abuse victim because that's all you ever talk about. You can't do anything but procrastinate. That's what you get for not having anything but your family to talk about. You look like you belong in a mental hospital. You're too stupid to come up with anything to say to us. What's the matter, you can't code? Aww. All you can do is cry. Are you obsessed with what a teenage female you are? You're only allowed to talk about yourself. You're not an actual nerd. You're a narcissist. Go to bed. Stop thinking about nothing but yourself. At least I don't have to go to work looking so bedridden. Looks like you have nothing to do. You're only allowed to hang out with us. Stop being such a self help guru. You need to get the fuck over yourself. You're to insecure to use your own mouth. You're too insecure to use your own brain. Get over yourself. Stop making yourself look like an abuse victim. Not everything is about you, okay? Nab nab nab. He needs to get over his face. Stop mowing at your own face. Bye! No one wants you to do anything but touch yourself. Ha ha ha! Am I interrupting your moment. Oh no! You don't need to do anything but look too good to go to school. We're not that narcissistic. You are! Bye Karlina! You're not allowed to anything but be a self help abuse victim." They continue to barrage me with verbal abuse as I write this note. Also, when I ask them questions, they almost never give me serious nor helpful answers. I think law enforcement is trying to torture me into social conformity and perhaps they are even torturing me for their own sadistic amusement. I don't think they like me. Hence, they do not seem to be at all opposed to bullying me. Seemingly no one can stop them because they are at at the top of the food chain in a covert totalitarian military dictatorship.
