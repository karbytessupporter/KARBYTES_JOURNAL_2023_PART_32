I caught about a minute of peace while standing inside the Pete's cafe waiting for the coffee I ordered to be made while I was staring out the window at the bright afternoon scenery of cars and people and small rooftop wind turbines turning and small birds landing. Relaxing and minimalist music was playing and I noticed the restaurant was populated by oldish looking adults sitting by themselves using phones or laptops. I thought about how I would likely be a lot more relaxed if I could travel and live inside a glass container insulating me from the environment yet still allowing me to observe it from a relatively privileged vantage. Speaking of the word "privilege", I saw some cryptic graffiti in San Francisco saying that privilege is vanity and that technology is corrosive to humanity. I'm back outside now to type this note before heading back up the hill. I wanted to redress what I said on this web page earlier today (in the section below this section) about women being less supportive of my transsexualism than men. I do not wish to generalize because I feel that I hardly have had sufficient involvement with other people to assess how other people generally feel about me. I have mostly been dealing with only anonymous thought police and, other than that, relatively brief, impersonal, and transactional social interactions only. I basically have no friends and I appear to be a schizoid (which I personally do not have a problem with and think is an advantageous adaptation). I have been turned off by how other people have treated me and how I have observed them behaving that I basically resigned myself to being friendless for the rest of my life and only socializing as minimally as necessary to get my basic needs met or to be of assistance to people who need it (if I feel I have the means to help them without seriously jeopardizing myself). I plan on being mostly celibate for the rest of my life and only having sex in casual situations in which I make it clear I'm single and intend to remain single. Other people frequently exhaust and annoy me and I have learned that trying to build a tolerance for their annoying and smothering antics only makes me angrier, more physically worn down, and less productive. Hence, I have basically issued humanity a "get well soon" card while I "sneak" away from them to a place where I can enjoy some respite away from humanity's intrusive sounds, fumes, and physical proximity. Humans take up so much space on Planet Earth and in my attention span. Hence, spending as much time in the wilderness away from humans as I can afford is something I intend to keep doing for the rest of my life because it gives me incomparable peace and joy. Many would likely call my frequent and long retreats into the wilderness elitism and, therefore, something to discourage. There does not seem to be enough idillic seclusion spaces to imbue every human with the kind of peace and joy I would not want to live without. That is a serious moral dilemma weighing on me. It compels me to say that I wish humans would have no more than two biological offspring each and for most humans to opt out of producing biological offspring so that the human population can shrink towards a more comfortable equilibrium point where there is more than enough physical resources (decent quality real estate especially) to go around such that every human can enjoy a "high end" leisure class existence which is supported by a universal basic income, widespread automation of essential services, and a more educated populous.
