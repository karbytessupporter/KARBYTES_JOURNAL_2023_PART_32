To elaborate on my latest Instagram comment, I think that the ban on public drag shows is primarily about showing disapproval for biological males wearing what is considered to be culturally feminine clothing and cosmetics and body movements. Men are supposed to not be portrayed in such an eroticized manner as are women. The implication is that biological women who engage in those same expressions are not considered to be inappropriate for children to observe. To elaborate, I think the banning of public drag shows is implicitly discouraging male-to-female transgenderism. I personally think that banning public drag shows is a violation of every person's unalienable right to (non violent) freedom of expression. With the logic of those public drag show bans, statues and paintings depicting nude humans in public museums might as well be made off limits to children. I don't think nudity nor even depictions of erotic acts should be made off limits to children. Instead, I think such things should be treated as normal and unremarkable and not something to get upset over. Kids will likely find out sexuality exists sooner or later. When adults make a big deal about it, it makes the kids more obsessed with it merely because it is being treated as forbidden.
