A note to delete (not worthy of making into WordPress page)...

I noticed over the years that girls have treated me like garbage for apparently identifying as a white male on the inside; for having thoughts like what a white male thinks.

I also noticed that those girls seemed to be opposed to the white guys I liked and who I thought were nice to me and helpful in imparting their knowledge on me.

I noticed those girls seemed to be sympathetic and approving of white males being mean to me.

Many people are opposed to me using a relatively peaceful and pollution free setting to work on my projects at. They think I ought to go to the grimy pollution filled slums instead.
