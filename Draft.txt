Update: I have reason to believe that my father has been trying to pick fights with me and to make me feel deprived of a place to sit down and not be physically intruded upon. He seems to tell lies quite often and pretend not to be able to mentally process things (presumably so that he gets to be treated like an innocent little kid rather). I think he has stolen some of my belongings including mail. He has acted angry and sullen whenever I seem happy and he seems happiest when I feel ambushed and disrespected. He does things I'm sure he knows I don't like such as smoke cigarettes in his house and try to get me to stop when I'm walking to get in the passenger seat of his car and offer me eggs even though I've been a vegan for years. He seems to do nothing with his life but wait for drama to unfold while claiming to be minding his own business. I could go into more detail and enumerate many examples of what I presume is my dad being a bully and drama monger but I decided to stop here and say that I thought about making up some violent offense which my dad committed against me in order to have him handcuffed and sent to prison but I would rather not make life for anyone harder than it has to be. I'm hoping that people who read this note will be able to read through the lines and see that I'm not really at odds with anyone other than less than five people who I think have been trying to make me miserable for years. I figure that such people suffer enough from the natural consequences of their behavior. Just because they are miserable and seemingly unwilling to change their behavior for the better does not mean I should have to settle for being just as miserable and lacking in self discipline as they are. It's not my responsibility to be those people's care taker or life coach or scapegoat.

I deleted the note which I added to GitHub as Draft.txt with the following commit comment:

<em>Brea the peacemaker convinced me to not add this update to my blog.</em>

That was in response to my cat running across the street to greet me after I returned from sitting about a block away from the house to write the note which I deleted from GitHub. Brea was crossing my path every time I tried to inch towards the house where I left my laptop to charge and, when Brea placed herself in front of me, she rolled around happily on the ground and acted extra cuddly and affectionate. So I decided to sit down and remove Draft.txt because I wanted to let bygones be bygones. Then Brea froze and looked up the driveway at the gray cat from next door who was sitting there watching with yellow eyes. After a few minutes both cats seemed to not be surprised nor agitated by each other's presence. Then both cats moved. Then I went inside to my room where my laptop was charging and noticed the sonic harasment from police get extremely irritating again. I would say that whoever is harassing me with those noises as at least as bad as any person I have ever known on a personal level in terms of how much they seem to be negatively interfering with my life (and getting away with it). I decided to include these notes in my latest journal entry.
