On the passed out wooks Instagram channel I saw the cutest thing all day so far: a guy sleeping or pretending to be sleeping on the ground at a hippie festival and people putting gifts on him. 

I know good things exist and that nice people exist. I'm apparently not supposed to know such things exist and, if anyone shows me a modicum of kindness, I have to believe it's a bait and switch or an implicit insult. I have been bullied into being mentally lopsided for the benefit of tyrants who want to keep the world from evolving.
