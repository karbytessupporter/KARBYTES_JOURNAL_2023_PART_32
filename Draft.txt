I went inside that saw that my dad was gone (but the drums were set back up in the garage). Disregard the previous complaint Draft.txt I made. The only people who are being abusive to me now are the thought police because they keep making abusive noises and saying things like, "I'm glad you're only allowed to be a girl here."
