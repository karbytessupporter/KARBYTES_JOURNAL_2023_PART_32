20_JUNE_2023: I noticed that, for some reason, the WayBack Machine has been failing to save a raw GitHub file of an image which is embedded in journal entry # x of 2023 (but the WayBack Machine did properly save that journal entry included that image which is embedded in that journal entry web page). I am in the Tenderloin district now of San Francisco about to go to my pap smear appointment. I noticed that, yesterday, the WayBack failed to properly save this web page the first time I submitted its URL to the WayBack Machine (but the second attempt was successfully). I felt somewhat obliged to elaborate on what I hastily wrote in this web page yesterday. I rather abruptly and cavalierly wrote it. I would follow up by saying that I think humanity has a long way to go in terms of women not been treated like dogs instead of self-sovereign and hardy individuals. My disdain for how women are socialized to think and behave is part of why I felt motivated to resume being a transman taking testosterone. Sadly, I seem to be getting a lot of disapproval from women who seem to think I am betraying them by not staying as low in testosterone and woman identified as they are. I get the overall sense that men generally understand my emotions and sense of priorities and worldview more than the women general do. That's because I'm not pretending to have the personality of a man. I remember feeling more like a male human than female human my entire life. I was not aware that I had the option to take masculinizing hormones until after I graduated high school. Before I graduated high school, I was extremely ignorant about things I now think I should have known by that age. Well, at least I'm making a valiant effort now to catch up to where I feel I ought to be on my goals. I have quite lofty ambitions and inspiring ideals about what is possible for myself and humanity in general (and such a visionary frame of mind compels me to not waste my time nor to settle for being depressed like other people seem to be and want me to also be).
