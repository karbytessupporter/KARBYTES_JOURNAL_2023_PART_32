<p>As I was walking home after spending some time in downtown Castro Valley, I had a rather intriguing thought: it could be that I have reincarnated thousands of times as a human individual in order to arrive at the lifetime I&#8217;m currently living (and each prior lifetime I&#8217;ve lived was lived in exactly one chronological order (i.e. from past to future instead of skipping around) such that each time I reincarnated, I was born into a more modern time period within the larger encompassing evolutionary timeline of human civilization and life on Planet Earth in general). If what I posited is true, then it could be said that my quality of life improved with each successive lifetime I&#8217;ve lived (in general). What I mean to imply is that each lifetime I&#8217;ve lived was essentially a level in a video game and, the more levels I played, the deeper my translifetime knowledge and skills became (and, as a result of acquiring sufficiently advanced game play abilities, I was able to incarnate into the best lifetime I&#8217;ve lived thus far). What is special about this particular lifetime which sets it apart from all the other ones I fancifully imagine having lived prior to this one is the fact that, during this time, I got to access digital and quantum computers, the Internet, and artificial intelligence which seems to pass the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turing Test</a> (and I also got to get live in a part of the world where it is easy for me to travel without much money and without many restrictions and to legally purchase psilocybin from local dispensaries which enabled me to venture deeper into the metaphysical fabric of reality to see how reality is likely a computer simulation and how I have reached a point in my translifetime evolution where I can manipulate the fabric of reality, replicate it on smaller scales, and achieve another &#8220;mystical&#8221; insight which I think is true: a person who is sufficiently conscious can literally transcend the illusion that physical reality is as rigid and limited as it is and see that it is 100% imaginary and therefore arbitrary (including the order of events and physical laws (but mathematics is another story since mathematics seems impossible to construe any other way than what I currently know it to be (which makes me think mathematics is the de facto language of all reality)))). I look forward to exploring this issue in more technical detail when I revise the web page of my primary website named MULTIVERSE. Finally, I decided to upload <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_summer_2023_starter_pack/blob/main/karbytes_guitar_07_june_2023.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this MP3 file</a> to the <a style="background: #00ff00;color: #000000" href="https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_summer_2023_starter_pack/tree/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object summer 2023 GitHub repository</a> (and that MP3 file was derived from <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_PART_30/main/instagram_karbytes_07_june_2023_part_0.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this MP4 file</a> of me playing a rather catchy guitar song in the dark a few weeks ago) so that I can use that MP3 file in my revised version of the web page of my primary website named SOUND_TRACK_LOOP_COUNTER.</p>
