I'm taking a while to publish this note because I don't want to feel rushed off the premises before I've had a chance to cool off emotionally. I am afraid other people are standing by to ensure that I don't get to emotionally cool down even if I take my time here. I usually don't masturbate more than once per day now and I usually wait until I am in a relatively secluded campsite before I masturbate (and what I vibrate my clitoris to is almost always some kind of surrealistic fantasy which amounts to "hate porn" against what I consider to be feigned helplessness in women). I can tell many people around here are more obsessed with my masturbation fantasies than they are with any other aspect of my existence. I don't masturbate because I enjoy it. I only masturbate to relieve unwanted tension; tension I feel others try to force me to accumulate against my will. It's almost as if I only masturbate in order to relieve other people of their tension. Otherwise, I probably would masturbate less often than once per month and I probably would have more of what I consider to be technophillic and what I consider to be philosophically relevant erotic fantasies. I would probably masturbate to subject matter which is not anthropomorphic nor anthropocentric such as the image of sinusoidal waves or supernovas exploding (because I have been able to organism to such thoughts before). I think too many humans are too dogmatically heteronormative and obsessed with making heterosexual sex prominent in my awareness for me to want to be friends with. I think I go to rather desperate lengths to avoid being sexualized and sexual against my will and that my preference to remain single and asexual is vehemently opposed by many humans. I intend to keep fighting to maintain self sovereignty instead of succumbing to being yet another victim of the cultural conditioning which pigeonholes humans into being sex obsessed and oppressively conformist to sex obsessed cultural norms. It seems like an act of defiance to stay single, abstain from sex, and to study mathematics because doing so goes against having to make some guy's lust the driving force of my existence. Nothing seems to matter more in mainstream human culture than heterosexual sexual tension's eternal contraction and release and monopolization of the attention economy. I probably sound like a "radical feminist" to some people for what I just said. To other people, I probably sound like a misogynist. To some people, I probably sound misanthropic. To me, I sound a bit too futuristic and/or unconventional to fit in well with the human society I currently live in.
