When I applied for CalFresh food stamps approximately three years ago, I remember only getting approximately $65 per week (which I think is very chinsy) and my food stamp coverage only lasted for three months because I was unemployed throughout that period and required to prove that I had a paid job in order to reinstate my food stamps.

When I asked my father how much money he gets in social security income (which apparently every citizen over age 65 years is eligible to receive), he said he got approximately $400 per month (and I think that is also very chinsy).

As far as I can tell, the United States of America does not provide adequate financial assistance to people without jobs. 

My father seems to be refusing to do much other than harass me every chance he gets in order to spur me to get a job and stay out of his way (and ideally move out) so that he can finally relax and enjoy the rest of his life without having to worry about me interrupting his privacy, wrecking his stuff, and feeling obliged to pay for me using what little money he has to not starve to death. 

Some people think I should rush to get a job before I do anything else today so that I can put my father out of his misery. I am just afraid that, if I do that, the job won't make enough money to pay for me to rent my own place to live. Hence, no matter how much money I make, I feel obligated to live on the streets or at my mom's house (and I think most people prefer the latter though I prefer the former so that I can enjoy what I think is sufficient privacy (and perhaps I can compromise by moving all my stuff to my mom's house and taking all my showers there and saying that I spend the night there instead of doing such things at my dad's house)).

Today I plan on leaving my stuff in my room at my dad's place and taking out one of my circuit breakers (which has multiple electrical outlets on it so that I can split a single public wall outlet into enough electrical outlets to charge my laptop, two portable laptop charging power banks, and phone simultaneously). I plan on applying for jobs no later than 01_AUGUST_2023.
