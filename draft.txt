One of my goals (as controversial as it seems) is not relying on a petroleum powered vehicle (especially one I don't own) as my primary means of transportation. Hence, I strive to continue only relying on ecologically sustainable and "communist" means of transportation to get between my living area and my future place of (paid (and tax paying)) employment by walking, bicycling, or riding BART trains. (I hope to own a fully electric car someday such as the Smart Car and, when I do travel outside the San Francisco Bay Area, I am open to other transportation means such as airplane, train, taxis, and car rental).

I am attempting to save up money for a cheap bicycle to order to pick up in store within the next two months.
