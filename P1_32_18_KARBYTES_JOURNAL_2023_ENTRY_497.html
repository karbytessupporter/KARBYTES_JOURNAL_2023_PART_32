<p><strong>KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_ENTRY_497</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>While sitting in my backyard, not more than five seconds has gone by before someone on the other side of the wall started talking loudly (and I think they are talking in order to prevent me from focusing on my own thoughts so that I keep my attention continuously focused on them). I also hear nearly constant hammers pounding loudly and what sounds like leaf blowers roaring. The timing of the sounds seems to be responsive to my sense of bodily and mental tension. I think other people are literally standing by intently surveiling my thoughts and feelings in order to prevent me from relaxing. I think those other people are adamantly trying to coerce me into thinking and acting in a way which appears to be a failure of self control on my part.</p>
<p>One reason I think the people in my midst are trying to cause me to &#8220;freak out&#8221; or to otherwise be prevented from conforming to how I prefer to think and behave is to torture me into getting a job and staying outside of Castro Valley a lot more than I have been during the past five weeks so that I am too preoccupied with work to have much time or space to think &#8220;outside the box&#8221; as deeply as I have been (and I doubt that it is possible for me to think deeply enough to &#8220;break through&#8221; the societal matrix if I am under as much time and social conformity constraints I think those neighbors want me to be). I hear the women&#8217;s and/or girls&#8217; voices on the other side of the fence talking shrilly and caustically and laughing in a brittle manner. I hear people saying ad hominem slurs which I think are uttered with the intent to provoke me into retaliating or otherwise reacting with what I consider to be &#8220;low brow&#8221; expressions. It could be that the people around me are revolting against what I wrote in the previous journal entry about proudly identifying as a schizoid. I think the people trying to micromanage me and upset me and evict me on the other side of the wall are opposed to my being proudly schizoid because they disapprove of how little I prefer to make women the center of my attention and how little I prefer to show approval towards women. (I am not opposed to women who are also schizoids or who at least avoid intentionally bullying or infringing upon schizoids).</p>
<p>In the second to last journal entry, I stated that I do not want to keep mentioning the kind of petty drama mongering (which typically manifests as gang stalking, targeted surveillance, and anti-autistic and anti-queer bullying) which I described a little bit in this journal entry. I am afraid that, if I impose any restrictions on myself, other people will attempt to coerce me into violating any rules which I set for myself. I think it is easier for me to proceed if I do not appear to have any self-imposed restrictions for how I behave and think.</p>
<p>Those females on the other side of the fence have been talking nonstop for what seems like half an hour. I thought I heard one of them say, &#8220;I&#8217;m waiting for her to take a poop.&#8221; What I think is meant by that is that whoever is on the other side of the fence (whether it&#8217;s law enforcement using electronic harassment to cause me to perceive specific messages or whether those messages are literally being spoken by the civilians the adjacent yard) is that they are impatiently waiting for me hurry up and output another stressed-out and unhinged-sounding blog post on my way away from this neighborhood.</p>
<p>In the past I used to be a lot more willing to comply with the pressure I feel from others to stay out of Castro Valley. Lately I&#8217;ve been a lot less willing to leave on a whim in order to avoid being tortured by people who seem to be trying to suppress my freedom of speech and thought and who are trying to make me homeless. The reason I am less accommodating of those who I think are acting like my oppressors is that I think that being too accommodating of such people will lead to me eventually acting out in an uncontrolled and violent manner which is ultimately self destructive. Hence, I think many people (especially residents of Castro Valley) are insinuating that I am being a tyrannical control freak merely for not being more compliant with their wishes.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m taking a while to publish this note because I don&#8217;t want to feel rushed off the premises before I&#8217;ve had a chance to cool off emotionally. I am afraid other people are standing by to ensure that I don&#8217;t get to emotionally cool down even if I take my time here. I usually don&#8217;t masturbate more than once per day now and I usually wait until I am in a relatively secluded campsite before I masturbate (and what I vibrate my clitoris to is almost always some kind of surrealistic fantasy which amounts to &#8220;hate porn&#8221; against what I consider to be feigned helplessness in women). I can tell many people around here are more obsessed with my masturbation fantasies than they are with any other aspect of my existence. I don&#8217;t masturbate because I enjoy it. I only masturbate to relieve unwanted tension; tension I feel others try to force me to accumulate against my will. It&#8217;s almost as if I only masturbate in order to relieve other people of their tension. Otherwise, I probably would masturbate less often than once per month and I probably would have more of what I consider to be technophillic and what I consider to be philosophically relevant erotic fantasies. I would probably masturbate to subject matter which is not anthropomorphic nor anthropocentric such as the image of sinusoidal waves or supernovas exploding (because I have been able to organism to such thoughts before). I think too many humans are too dogmatically heteronormative and obsessed with making heterosexual sex prominent in my awareness for me to want to be friends with. I think I go to rather desperate lengths to avoid being sexualized and sexual against my will and that my preference to remain single and asexual is vehemently opposed by many humans. I intend to keep fighting to maintain self sovereignty instead of succumbing to being yet another victim of the cultural conditioning which pigeonholes humans into being sex obsessed and oppressively conformist to sex obsessed cultural norms. It seems like an act of defiance to stay single, abstain from sex, and to study mathematics because doing so goes against having to make some guy&#8217;s lust the driving force of my existence. Nothing seems to matter more in mainstream human culture than heterosexual sexual tension&#8217;s eternal contraction and release and monopolization of the attention economy. I probably sound like a &#8220;radical feminist&#8221; to some people for what I just said. To other people, I probably sound like a misogynist. To some people, I probably sound misanthropic. To me, I sound a bit too futuristic and/or unconventional to fit in well with the human society I currently live in.</p>
