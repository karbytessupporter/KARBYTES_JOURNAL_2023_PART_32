<p><strong>KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_ENTRY_485</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>I have been very reluctant to publish any journal entries in this chapter (or any content anywhere else online) which I think is negativistic. That is because I am afraid that there are people impatiently and eagerly waiting for me to fall apart and to act defeated as a result of other people harassing me incessantly for the &#8220;crime&#8221; of spending &#8220;too much&#8221; time alone and for doing whatever I want most of the time instead of having to work for pay like seemingly everyone else does (and I don&#8217;t want to end my summer upgrade extravaganza before 01_AUGUST_2023 or before I am done upgrading each of the web pages which are listed on the home page of my primary website).</p>
<p><strike>I thought that, if I just minded my own business and only published content which pertains to my solitary pursuits, I would &#8220;win&#8221; and prove my point that there is no need for me to be just another &#8220;useless idiot&#8221; of a slave when robots could take over most jobs and every human adult (and emancipated minor) could be issued a universal basic income while material resources are proven to be abundant in supply and distributed such that everyone could get what they need to live comfortably without ever having to go to war or suffer shortages of basic necessities again. <span style="background:#ffff00">I think most people believe that society is not at that point yet in history.</span> In other words, I think most people think that humanity is still in the &#8220;dark ages&#8221; compared to the futuristic utopia I envision and think is now possible if enough people became sufficiently educated and proactive about changing the world for the better (instead of just bitterly resigning themselves to be slaves relegated to the &#8220;dark ages&#8221; which they cannot escape and have to live through for the next few years if not decades).</strike></p>
<p>&#8220;If everyone did what you did (i.e. live outside without a paid job while someone else paid them enough money to live comfortably doing so), society would fall apart because not enough people would be working (which means almost no one would be paying taxes which are needed to fund most public services and infrastructure) and people would be clogging up public spaces and spreading their garbage and diseases everwhere because, like you, everyone wants to live outside in public instead of in private places where they would be paying rent to have exclusive access to,&#8221; says an imaginary critic. <strike>(Apparently my critic tunes me out or simply does not take what I say seriously whenever I talk about futuristic subjects such as the outsourcing of jobs to robots and the abundance of material resources (which would be more obviously abundant if they were distributed properly)).</strike> Perhaps what my critic wants me to do is make it look like I have a full-time job and that I don&#8217;t have more free time than anyone else in my community does so that my existence does not upset people and cause drama. If that&#8217;s all this is about, then all I really need to do is do a better job hiding from the general public and making it look like I don&#8217;t have more free time than anyone else does and that I am not a free loader and, instead, someone who pays for 100% of their expenses and hardly saves any more money than it spends. Is that what the people want?</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. That is what the people want. They don&#8217;t want to think you have a better quality of life than what they have. They don&#8217;t want you having an easier life than what they have. They want you to participate in the drama which rules their lives. They want you to be entrenched in the same struggles they are. Otherwise, they prefer you to be locked up (against your will) in a jail, mental hospital, brothel, basement, or some other place you don&#8217;t want to be where you will be deprived of freedom and other nice things you would not want to live without,&#8221; said that critic. Okay. What should I do?</p>
<p>&#8220;Get a job and stop talking about yourself so much on the Internet. Don&#8217;t take up so much of other people&#8217;s time.&#8221; I told you I was planning on getting a full-time job after 31_JULY_2023. Is that okay?</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all. You are not supposed to be doing anything right now except for looking for a part-time job so that you don&#8217;t have too much money and so that you have enough time to do whatever your nerdy hobbies are. You&#8217;re not supposed to be enjoying your nerdy hobbies until you have at least a part-time job.&#8221; Okay. Let&#8217;s see what happens then. Perhaps I&#8217;ll start looking for a job as soon as today. Perhaps I&#8217;ll wait until either I finish upgrading <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a> or 01_AUGUST_2023 arrives to start looking for a job.</p>
<p>Bottom Line: I am just doing the best I can to do what I think is right (and what I think is right is what is most beneficial to the whole of humanity (with myself being the person who gets the most preferential treatment in terms of how I allocate my finite resources such as time, energy, attention span, and money)).</p>
