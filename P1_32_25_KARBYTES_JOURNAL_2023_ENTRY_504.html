<p><strong>KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_ENTRY_504</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>As a corollary to some of the previous journal entry web pages which I wrote as part of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_part_32/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this blog chapter</a>, I wanted to comment that I have come to the conclusion that I will probably not be able to do anything without being forced to listen to sonic harassment and to otherwise be interfered with and surveilled by law enforcement for an indefinitely long period of time extending into the future. (Click <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_138/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> for more technical details about the &#8220;technological telepathy&#8221; I just described). Even when I was working as a paid employee (post 13_FEBRUARY_2019) I was dealing with such things the entire time. The significance of this journal entry is to inform myself and others the following: waiting for that interference to stop and trying to negotiate with the enforcers of that harassment is probably a waste of my time. Hence, I should proceed with doing what I think is necessary to achieve my goals while expecting to have to deal with that harassment. Goals I will have to take off my list are being as happy, relaxed, and efficient with my time as I prefer to be (because such things seem to have to be reduced by some percent less than 80% due to the fact that dealing with that harassment is undeniably stressful for me and, because I want to be physically and mentally fit (and to be what I consider to be attractive in terms of what I look like and how I behave and think) and to make my primary website as high quality as possible and to still keep studying subject matter which is intellectually rigorous, I have to take more time than I think I would without such harassment to accomplish the tasks which I set out to do).</p>
<p>If it is any consolation to myself, most of the people in my midst seem to be nice people who are not trying to stop me from doing what I set out to do. Most of the people in my midst seem to be minding their own business and not stalking nor harassing me. I do not think that is the case with every civilian and I do not think that is the case with every military or law enforcement agent, but from what I can tell, there do seem to be many people in Castro Valley and in the larger encompassing San Francisco Bay Area who share many of my interests and values and who would be sympathetic and helpful towards me if I interacted with them because such people think that what I am doing and what I am thinking and feeling is not a bad thing. Keeping that in mind helps me to cope with the adversity I face on a daily basis.</p>
