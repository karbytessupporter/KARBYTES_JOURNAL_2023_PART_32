<p>20_JUNE_2023: I caught about a minute of peace while standing inside the Pete&#8217;s cafe waiting for the coffee I ordered to be made while I was staring out the window at the bright afternoon scenery of cars and people and small rooftop wind turbines turning and small birds landing. Relaxing and minimalist music was playing and I noticed the restaurant was populated by oldish looking adults sitting by themselves using phones or laptops. I thought about how I would likely be a lot more relaxed if I could travel and live inside a glass container insulating me from the environment yet still allowing me to observe it from a relatively privileged vantage. Speaking of the word &#8220;privilege&#8221;, I saw some cryptic graffiti in San Francisco saying that privilege is vanity and that technology is corrosive to humanity. I&#8217;m back outside now to type this note before heading back up the hill. I wanted to redress what I said on this web page earlier today (in the section below this section) about women being less supportive of my transsexualism than men. I do not wish to generalize because I feel that I hardly have had sufficient involvement with other people to assess how other people generally feel about me. I have mostly been dealing with only anonymous thought police and, other than that, relatively brief, impersonal, and transactional social interactions only. I basically have no friends and I appear to be a schizoid (which I personally do not have a problem with and think is an advantageous adaptation). I have been turned off by how other people have treated me and how I have observed them behaving that I basically resigned myself to being friendless for the rest of my life and only socializing as minimally as necessary to get my basic needs met or to be of assistance to people who need it (if I feel I have the means to help them without seriously jeopardizing myself). I plan on being mostly celibate for the rest of my life and only having sex in casual situations in which I make it clear I&#8217;m single and intend to remain single. Other people frequently exhaust and annoy me and I have learned that trying to build a tolerance for their annoying and smothering antics only makes me angrier, more physically worn down, and less productive. Hence, I have basically issued humanity a &#8220;get well soon&#8221; card while I &#8220;sneak&#8221; away from them to a place where I can enjoy some respite away from humanity&#8217;s intrusive sounds, fumes, and physical proximity. Humans take up so much space on Planet Earth and in my attention span. Hence, spending as much time in the wilderness away from humans as I can afford is something I intend to keep doing for the rest of my life because it gives me incomparable peace and joy. Many would likely call my frequent and long retreats into the wilderness elitism and, therefore, something to discourage. There does not seem to be enough idyllic seclusion spaces to imbue every human with the kind of peace and joy I would not want to live without. That is a serious moral dilemma weighing on me. It compels me to say that I wish humans would have no more than two biological offspring each and for most humans to opt out of producing biological offspring so that the human population can shrink towards a more comfortable equilibrium point where there is more than enough physical resources (decent quality real estate especially) to go around such that every human can enjoy a &#8220;high end&#8221; leisure class existence which is supported by a universal basic income, widespread automation of essential services, and a more educated populous.</p>

<p>20_JUNE_2023: I noticed that, for some reason, the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WayBack Machine</a> has been failing to save a raw GitHub file of an image which is embedded in <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_490/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journal entry # 490 of 2023</a> (but the WayBack Machine did properly save that journal entry included that image which is embedded in that journal entry web page). I am in the Tenderloin district now of San Francisco about to go to my pap smear appointment. I noticed that, yesterday, the WayBack Machine failed to properly save this web page the first time I submitted its URL to the WayBack Machine (but the second attempt was successfully). I felt somewhat obliged to elaborate on what I hastily wrote in this web page yesterday. I rather abruptly and cavalierly wrote it. I would follow up by saying that I think humanity has a long way to go in terms of women not been treated like dogs instead of self-sovereign and hardy individuals. My disdain for how women are socialized to think and behave is part of why I felt motivated to resume being a transman taking testosterone. Sadly, I seem to be getting a lot of disapproval from women who seem to think I am betraying them by not staying as low in testosterone and woman identified as they are. I get the overall sense that men generally understand my emotions and sense of priorities and worldview more than the women general do. That&#8217;s because I&#8217;m not pretending to have the personality of a man. I remember feeling more like a male human than female human my entire life. I was not aware that I had the option to take masculinizing hormones until after I graduated high school. Before I graduated high school, I was extremely ignorant about things I now think I should have known by that age. Well, at least I&#8217;m making a valiant effort now to catch up to where I feel I ought to be on my goals. I have quite lofty ambitions and inspiring ideals about what is possible for myself and humanity in general (and such a visionary frame of mind compels me to not waste my time nor to settle for being depressed like other people seem to be and want me to also be).</p>

<p>19_JUNE_2023: Perhaps my least favorite voice which harasses me through <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_138/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;technological telepathy&#8221;</a> is what sounds like a high pitched adult female human&#8217;s voice speaking in a nonchalant, breathy, and sing-song tone (which is sometimes whispering) which also sounds depressed and irritable while emitting verbal phrases which are almost always snarky and sarcastic put-downs expressing discontent at the fact that I am not spending more time in the presence of other humans and, also, expressing discontent over the fact that I fact that I do not seem to be more worried about money.</p>
<p>The thought police which perpetuate the pervasive electronic harassment I described in the previous paragraph seem to be getting away with violating my First Amendment right by interfering with my personal religion (which is non-violent and non-intrusive towards humans other than myself), interrupting my thoughts, and interjecting their own words into my thought stream which seem oppositional to the goals I have which pertain to my personal religion. To be succinct, I think I am being severely mistreated (and to make matters worse for me, I have observed behavior from other civilians which suggests that the vast majority of humans are either indifferent to the fact that I feel severely mistreated in the manner I described or else those humans condone such mistreatment and are acting as &#8220;civilian cops&#8221; who go out of their way to perpetuate such mistreatment towards me).</p>
<p>A complaint I hear frequently through such harassment is that I am &#8220;too self focused&#8221;. I disagree that I am &#8220;too self focused&#8221; because my personal religion is about spending a lot more time in solitude than I think most humans are used to and condone. I think people are generally strongly opposed to my implemented preference to spend what they think is excessive time alone doing things which do not seem to detract from other humans&#8217; lives such as developing open source software applications and meditating because my engaging in those solitary endeavors provoke those people&#8217;s insecurities about not being very far along in their own personal endeavors for reasons such as having scant free time (especially time in solitude) to pursue such endeavors and not apparently having as many desirable accommodations as what I have (and what I seem to have which those other people do not have is house to live in rent-free which is located in a safe and scenic part of the San Francisco Bay Area east bay region bordering expansive regional parks which provide me accessible respite from urban and suburban environments and money from parents which is sufficient to allow me to live relatively comfortably while practicing my religion whose values are environmental sustainability, authentic self expression, personal development, and studying STEM related subject matter (and STEM is an acronym for Science Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)).</p>
<p>People seem to be implying that I am not doing enough to serve other people. I think I am doing enough to serve other people by minimizing my harmful ecological impact, keeping to myself instead of involving myself in other people&#8217;s business, and focusing on building my skills and knowledge and doing things which I think are constructive rather than corrosive to my well being or to other people&#8217;s well being.</p>
<p>The people who seem opposed to how I currently live seem to dismiss how little my activities negatively interfere with other people&#8217;s lives. The people who seem opposed to how I currently live seem to be jealous and insecure tyrants (or loyalists to such) who want to eliminate what they think is competition to their ability to be socially influential and admired by those they indoctrinate and subordinate. It is what I deem to be typical alpha male behavior: territorialism and monopolization of scarce resources for the sake of ensuring that only some people&#8217;s genes and memes continue to proliferate. I would even go so far as to suggest that most of the social, economic, and environmental injustices which humans are most plagued by and complain about are fundamentally symptoms of male apes trying to protect their egos from feeling diminished by what they see as competition. I think such tyranny reinforced rather extreme sexual dimorphism in humans which favored women being significantly weaker than men (because such a configuration forced women to have to defer to men who used physical coercion to get his way).</p>
