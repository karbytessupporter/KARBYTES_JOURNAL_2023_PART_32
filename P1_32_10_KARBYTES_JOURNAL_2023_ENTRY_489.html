<p>20_JUNE_2023: I noticed that, for some reason, the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WayBack Machine</a> has been failing to save a raw GitHub file of an image which is embedded in <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_490/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journal entry # 490 of 2023</a> (but the WayBack Machine did properly save that journal entry included that image which is embedded in that journal entry web page). I am in the Tenderloin district now of San Francisco about to go to my pap smear appointment. I noticed that, yesterday, the WayBack Machine failed to properly save this web page the first time I submitted its URL to the WayBack Machine (but the second attempt was successfully). I felt somewhat obliged to elaborate on what I hastily wrote in this web page yesterday. I rather abruptly and cavalierly wrote it. I would follow up by saying that I think humanity has a long way to go in terms of women not been treated like dogs instead of self-sovereign and hardy individuals. My disdain for how women are socialized to think and behave is part of why I felt motivated to resume being a transman taking testosterone. Sadly, I seem to be getting a lot of disapproval from women who seem to think I am betraying them by not staying as low in testosterone and woman identified as they are. I get the overall sense that men generally understand my emotions and sense of priorities and worldview more than the women general do. That&#8217;s because I&#8217;m not pretending to have the personality of a man. I remember feeling more like a male human than female human my entire life. I was not aware that I had the option to take masculinizing hormones until after I graduated high school. Before I graduated high school, I was extremely ignorant about things I now think I should have known by that age. Well, at least I&#8217;m making a valiant effort now to catch up to where I feel I ought to be on my goals. I have quite lofty ambitions and inspiring ideals about what is possible for myself and humanity in general (and such a visionary frame of mind compels me to not waste my time nor to settle for being depressed like other people seem to be and want me to also be).</p>

<p>19_JUNE_2023: Perhaps my least favorite voice which harasses me through <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_138/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;technological telepathy&#8221;</a> is what sounds like a high pitched adult female human&#8217;s voice speaking in a nonchalant, breathy, and sing-song tone (which is sometimes whispering) which also sounds depressed and irritable while emitting verbal phrases which are almost always snarky and sarcastic put-downs expressing discontent at the fact that I am not spending more time in the presence of other humans and, also, expressing discontent over the fact that I fact that I do not seem to be more worried about money.</p>
<p>The thought police which perpetuate the pervasive electronic harassment I described in the previous paragraph seem to be getting away with violating my First Amendment right by interfering with my personal religion (which is non-violent and non-intrusive towards humans other than myself), interrupting my thoughts, and interjecting their own words into my thought stream which seem oppositional to the goals I have which pertain to my personal religion. To be succinct, I think I am being severely mistreated (and to make matters worse for me, I have observed behavior from other civilians which suggests that the vast majority of humans are either indifferent to the fact that I feel severely mistreated in the manner I described or else those humans condone such mistreatment and are acting as &#8220;civilian cops&#8221; who go out of their way to perpetuate such mistreatment towards me).</p>
<p>A complaint I hear frequently through such harassment is that I am &#8220;too self focused&#8221;. I disagree that I am &#8220;too self focused&#8221; because my personal religion is about spending a lot more time in solitude than I think most humans are used to and condone. I think people are generally strongly opposed to my implemented preference to spend what they think is excessive time alone doing things which do not seem to detract from other humans&#8217; lives such as developing open source software applications and meditating because my engaging in those solitary endeavors provoke those people&#8217;s insecurities about not being very far along in their own personal endeavors for reasons such as having scant free time (especially time in solitude) to pursue such endeavors and not apparently having as many desirable accommodations as what I have (and what I seem to have which those other people do not have is house to live in rent-free which is located in a safe and scenic part of the San Francisco Bay Area east bay region bordering expansive regional parks which provide me accessible respite from urban and suburban environments and money from parents which is sufficient to allow me to live relatively comfortably while practicing my religion whose values are environmental sustainability, authentic self expression, personal development, and studying STEM related subject matter (and STEM is an acronym for Science Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)).</p>
<p>People seem to be implying that I am not doing enough to serve other people. I think I am doing enough to serve other people by minimizing my harmful ecological impact, keeping to myself instead of involving myself in other people&#8217;s business, and focusing on building my skills and knowledge and doing things which I think are constructive rather than corrosive to my well being or to other people&#8217;s well being.</p>
<p>The people who seem opposed to how I currently live seem to dismiss how little my activities negatively interfere with other people&#8217;s lives. The people who seem opposed to how I currently live seem to be jealous and insecure tyrants (or loyalists to such) who want to eliminate what they think is competition to their ability to be socially influential and admired by those they indoctrinate and subordinate. It is what I deem to be typical alpha male behavior: territorialism and monopolization of scarce resources for the sake of ensuring that only some people&#8217;s genes and memes continue to proliferate. I would even go so far as to suggest that most of the social, economic, and environmental injustices which humans are most plagued by and complain about are fundamentally symptoms of male apes trying to protect their egos from feeling diminished by what they see as competition. I think such tyranny reinforced rather extreme sexual dimorphism in humans which favored women being significantly weaker than men (because such a configuration forced women to have to defer to men who used physical coercion to get his way).</p>
