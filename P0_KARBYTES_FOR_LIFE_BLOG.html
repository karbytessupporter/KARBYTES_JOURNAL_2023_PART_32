<p>Today I uploaded a <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_PART_32/main/karbytes_guitar_25_june_2023.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a> of me playing an acoustic guitar song which follows a chord progression pattern which I invented back in 2008 (so the song has a particular nostalgic quality which is unlike the other guitar songs I am featuring in my SOUND_TRACK_LOOP_COUNTER software application tutorial web page on my primary website). I plan on using today&#8217;s guitar recording as one of the four guitar sound tracks for the aforementioned web page. Other sound tracks which are included on that web page are a recording of frogs croaking and a recording of me playing the (acoustic) drums. (I think the three guitar songs which I recorded before today&#8217;s guitar song recording fit the theme of my brand better, but I decided to include today&#8217;s song in my primary website because it feels like it ties together two separate eras of my life: the era back when I felt relatively &#8220;pure&#8221; and &#8220;innocent&#8221; and &#8220;relaxed&#8221; and the era afterwards when I felt more like some thug and ostracized person being drafted into a war and having to deal with more seedy, stressful, and political subject matter). My favorite guitar song in that collection of four guitar songs is karbytes_guitar_07_june_2023.mp3 because it best captures the spirit of my <u>Summer Camp by Karbytes</u> experience. When I listen to that song, it evokes mental imagery of the mountains, trees, and traveling through dark and scary passages and the transitions between night and day and vice versa. For me, that song has a fun and adventurous feel. It&#8217;s not something I can easily repeat (like karbytes_guitar_13_may_2023.mp3) because those songs were improvised and not &#8220;muscle memory&#8221; songs like the other two guitar songs.</p>
<p>An unrelated note about something which happened today and which brightened my mood was walking past what looked like a former classmate from one of my computer science classes at California State University East Bay who I will refer to using the initials MK walking near the area within a block of her house (and I remember being invited over there to hang out and have dinner and I got to meet her father who apparently works for the Internet Archive and her older sister was on the high school cross country team I was on and SED fancied her back when she was taking college classes while still in high school (small world) and I had a crush on MK and the last time we hung out was several years ago in my old bedroom on New Year&#8217;s eve to watch movies (just me, her, and SED and we were all cuddled up together on my couch of a bed) and we were playing games like Twister and working on group assignments for class). Anyway, when I saw MK walking past me today (or what looked like MK) I did not say anything because I was and still am embarrassed but happy to be reminded of her existence and what I fancied about her; her calm, reserved, and confident demeanor. These days I much prefer to be alone as a schizoid for life. I am not trying to hang out with people any time soon (but I might go out of my way to hang out with people someday). I am not trying to have sex with anyone any time soon (but I might go out of my way to have casual sex someday). I am just trying to be a modern monk and technophile and nerd who spends as much time as possible alone and immersed in solitary interests. The previous sentence captures the essence of what I want my life to be about indefinitely into the future. The only contexts I envision myself really enjoying and making a staple of my routine is associating with and collaborating with people who are interested in the same things I am in a professional context; not in a party or romantic context (though I am open minded and open to the idea of having fun with other people in ways I said or feel uninterested in now so long as I do not feel coerced into doing things I don&#8217;t want to nor doing things which I think are a waste of my time, money, and energy (because I am capable of changing my mind)).</p>
