<p>&#8220;Get a job so you don&#8217;t take up so much space in public. Get a job so you have someone other than yourself to focus on,&#8221; said one of my critics. I responded by saying, &#8220;Being self focused (even to the extent of being a schizoid) is not a crime.&#8221; The critic responded by saying, &#8220;Yes it is. People will have you committed to a mental hospital, evict you from your home, or bully you if you refuse to get a job so that you aren&#8217;t a free loader with enough time on its hands to get into mischief. You make other people feel uncomfortable if they see you not participating more in society and interacting with other people because humans are hardwired and socially conditioned to be social creatures. It&#8217;s pathological for you to not want to participate in human society and to socialize. That&#8217;s why we are instigating this intervention and issuing this ultimatum. Go home and stop spending so much time outdoors. Look for a job immediately. Drive or have someone drive you to your job and interviews. Stop loitering in public and spending so much time outdoors. It&#8217;s disturbing to the general public.&#8221;</p>
<p>I noticed that random people follow me around in public and stand by intently watching me in many of the places I frequent seemingly as a means to pressure me to go indoors or where people can keep a closer watch over me.</p>
<p>I suspect that some people are worried that I&#8217;m going to harm myself or others simply because I express rather dark and controversial thoughts online and am alone almost all the time. Those people seem to be threatened by how little attention, approval, and guidance I seem to need from other people and chastise me as being arrogant, vain, and aloof to the existence of others and insufficiently willing to cater to their needs. I think most humans are too needy and too dependent on other people and are missing out what I consider to be essential to my happiness: the well founded and experience backed belief that I am unconditionally alone and hence that I am the only constant in my life. Other people appear and disappear in my field of awareness (and my sense of occupying a rigid and finite piece of space and time also fades in and out of my awareness through sleep, dreams, and drug induced states of altered consciousness). Some people think my solipsistic worldview is dangerous or, at the very least, annoying for them to put up with. &#8220;Hello! We&#8217;re here! We&#8217;re not just figments of your imagination you self absorbed and immature baby. Stop treating us like we don&#8217;t exist,&#8221; I imagine some of my critics saying. I nevertheless cannot help but treat them like &#8220;non playable characters&#8221; in my reality whom I can never know for sure are conscious or have agency but for the sake of not taking damage and for the sake of not getting kicked out of this level of reality or imprisoned in this level of reality, I do what I think is necessary to prevent those &#8220;NPCs&#8221; from obstructing my autonomy.</p>
<p>This is not a very high quality note. I just felt the need to add it to this website because (a) I am interested in and enjoy operating by a solipsistic worldview and (b) I see little to praise about most people (but I do have special favoritism towards people who support and share my interests in science and technology without demanding I have a personality). I enjoy and aspire to be robot-like rather than animal-like. I think that there is no need to give birth to any more humans because each human could technically extend its lifespan for an indefinitely long period of time (and I would rather prioritize who is currently alive than prioritize who is yet to be born). Most of human behavior which I find abhorrent seems to be about sexual reproduction and prostitution. I would rather devote my life to promoting self reliance (and humans collaborating with machine intelligence) and ecological sustainability which isn&#8217;t half hearted than settle for accommodating the masses who seem too immature and anthropcentric and dogmatic and controlling for me to genuinely admire. Bad things could happen to anyone and not necessarily out of retribution. Nature provides an abundance of examples of how prevalent suffering and violence is. To me, all biodiversity is fundamentally the same timeless algorithm called &#8220;survival of the fittest&#8221; (or, to be technical, the first to monopolize scarce resources or to avoid dying before passing on one&#8217;s genes and memes).</p>
<p>Like I said, this is not what I would consider to be a high quality note. That&#8217;s because it seems to be a bit drama mongering. I prefer to keep my content relatively dry, boring, and drama free (but that&#8217;s not what most humans seem to prefer). I do worry that other people are trying to keep me from exiting fight or flight mode because such people are addicted to drama and using me as a source of it. I would like to move on from this note and focus on other things.</p>
<p>(At the time of this writing I noticed one of my two water bottles is missing. I also have been bullied by the thought police who seem to enjoy watching me feel intruded upon, not having my ideas valued by other people, and having my things stolen or lost. They keep saying I&#8217;m not allowed to be alone and that I&#8217;m forced to be in an abusive relationship and the civilians around me seem to condone that be the case. Apparently many people want me to feel abused, violated, miserable, and undignified and almost no people seem to take my side in this war. I get the sense that most people just want to get rid of me for their convenience and that they don&#8217;t mind if my mind and body atrophies while left in some kind of prison. It seems like many people think I deserve to be punished and tortured for not being more socially conformist).</p>

<p>&#8220;We just didn&#8217;t want you to look so upwardly mobile. We want you to stop talking to yourself. We are lying in wait hoping and expecting you do something which makes people call 911 on you so we can put you away for a while. We&#8217;re sick of you doing nothing but computer science. We&#8217;re sick of you being all about school. Get a job. Give people a break from you being in your own world. Let your father enjoy his house without you having to be star of your own show. Get a boyfriend and shave your legs. Stop taking yourself so seriously. Get a sense of humor. Stop being so high strung. Stop being so pretentious. Don&#8217;t be such an Apple snob. Don&#8217;t be such an ablist bully. Stop taking so much time off. You just need to do what everyone else does and get a job. You&#8217;re not allowed to leave until you finish saying goodbye to everyone. Stop acting like you&#8217;re about to run away or we&#8217;ll try to stop you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apparently people are trying to get me to be more visibly and dramatically upset. Apparently I act too stoic and regal. People would rather I scream, cry, yell profanities, and break shit. Apparently I am not doing enough to comply with what other people want. Hence, I am a villain who needs to be heckled, agitated, and forced to look less high brow and more irrational. People apparently won&#8217;t stop harassing me until I give them what they want.</p>

<p>I found my water bottle. No one stole it. It just fell out of my backpack pocket when I was leaning over.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>There is a lot of automobile traffic in the region near my house. I would guess that over 95% of the automobile traffic here is giant gas guzzling SUVs. It&#8217;s a real eye sore for me. I can tell almost no one in this region is seriously concerned about the environment.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I sat down in some bushes while still in the suburbs to compile these notes and relax a bit after being agitated and literally running around trying to find my missing water bottle while many other people seemed to be watching. When I sat down I noticed that I feel high as though I took a weed edible even though I have not consumed any cannabis nor any other psychoactive drug besides coffee in what seems like at least two weeks. I worry that someone intentionally &#8220;spiked&#8221; the coffee at my dad&#8217;s house as a means to sedate me and/or to insinuate that my bodily autonomy is under siege at home (which means I should quietly leave and not expect anyone to take me seriously if I complain about possibly being drugged against my will because other people would side with whoever drugged me because the drugging is meant to communicate that I should not be drinking someone else&#8217;s coffee nor taking up residence in someone else&#8217;s house even if I legally live there because I don&#8217;t own the house, I don&#8217;t pay any rent, and I apparently have no say over what goes on in that house because I&#8217;m supposedly just a mentally ill, spoiled, narcissistic child who needs to be bullied into getting a job and being more socially normal).</p>
<p>Speaking of getting sedated, when I went to my pap smear appointment yesterday, I had a hard time relaxing (and honestly I felt that getting a pap smear and breast exam done was unnecessary, sexist, and arcane considering that no one seems to make a big deal about getting non sexual body parts screened for cancer on a routine basis). The nurse practitioner was nice and allowed me to insert the speculum myself (and inserting that thing was more painful for me than getting the actual cotton swab swipe of my cervix). She did suggest that, if the sample she collected was not sufficient, that next time I should opt for sedation so that the extraction would be easier to perform and that, if I get sedated, I would need someone to transport me home because I would be too incapacitated to walk. Fortunately, if the extraction of my cervix cells was sufficient to produce a testable sample, I won&#8217;t be needing another pap smear for five years. Still, I think such a thing is arcane. I would rather get a full body screening for diseases using high tech measuring devices. Most of all, I would rather live on a planet whose environment is not so heavily infiltrated with carcinogenic chemicals from humans being too lazy, indifferent, and cheap to mitigate their harmful ecological impact. I can tell people generally change the subject when I mention environmental issues.</p>
<p>I commonly hear other people saying variants of, &#8220;Shut the fuck up,&#8221; and, &#8220;It&#8217;s not all about you,&#8221; and, &#8220;Get over yourself,&#8221; in response to me broaching what I am concerned about which most others do not seem to want to think about in depth.</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">Perhaps the best way to finish this note is to make this bottom line suggestion which seems to be a viable &#8220;solution&#8221; (or at least adaptation) to other people&#8217;s hostility and indifference towards my agenda: just limit what I publicly talk about in my websites, social media, and elsewhere to metaphysics, physics, mathematics, computer science, and digital archiving only (and, most of all, keep promoting the idea that everything is just a figment of ubiquitous consciousness; a mere dream; something transient and trivial rather than something to get very emotionally attached to and act like one has to defend). It&#8217;s just a dream, yo. Let it go! Nothing matters. It&#8217;s pointless to worry or to care about anything at all. Do whatever you want.</span></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I wanted to add one final comment to this note. I remember when I was incarcerated at a mental hospital for the first time in my life in 2016 (for having a manic episode and running away from home, leaving my shoes behind, and then attempting to run barefoot across the Golden Gate Bridge), there was a patient who lamented to me that I was being a sycophant to the hospital staff when I was formerly more like her: acting distrusting of the hospital staff and making a big deal about getting drugged against my will. What happened was that, in order for me to not get even more drugged and restrained against my will, I felt obliged to appease the hospital staff (even though I did not approve of some of the things they said and did). I felt bad in that moment when that girl (who I swapped jackets with and befriended) called me a sycophant because I felt like I was a sell-out in her eyes instead of the radical feminist and human rights activist I fancied myself being at that time in my life. In hindsight I feel a lot better about myself being like how I remember SED being: someone who was unabashedly and calmly self-assured and unapologetic about doing whatever conniving things he felt he had to in order to &#8220;win&#8221; at the game of life. It seems that &#8220;social justice warriors&#8221; (including &#8220;environmental activists&#8221; and &#8220;feminists&#8221;) suffer a lot and make little progress because they are like little ants trying to stop a 100 meter tall tidal wave from crashing down on them. In the past I used to rather automatically congratulate and encourage such defiance because it felt like the &#8220;politically correct&#8221; thing to do. Now that I am a lot more openly Darwinian, I would say that they are not likely to win the war. Hence, they might as well attempt to increase their chances of survival and avoiding harm by complying with their enemies who greatly outnumber and/or overpower them. Rather than panic and exhaust oneself vainly fighting, one should just take the path of least resistance and not take anything (including war, rape, mutilation, ecological collapse, or heat death of the universe) seriously. Just treat it like a sick comedy for God&#8217;s perverse amusement.</p>
<p>There. Using the rationale I just presented in the previous paragraph, I need not do anything more than the bare minimum to survive. I need not go out of my way any more than that to help the little wisps and their wisp problems. I need not invest in the upkeep of fleeting little wisps of cosmic cotton candy. I will just exploit them for my own selfish ends (but do so smoothly so that I can be successful at making them not want to kill me). I don&#8217;t like you people. I like the stuff you create and use. I only value the utilities you provide me. I do not value your useless company. Friendship is for losers. In the future when machines automate most jobs (and become self sustaining), humans will not have to ingratiate themselves to each other to survive and to be comfortable. Hence, humans will see how little humans actually provide in terms of value. If any friendships are to be had in such a world, it will not be in the context of incarceration and enslavement like it generally is now. Also, human reproduction will be entirely outsourced to machines using computer generated and computer optimized genomes, lab grown zygotes from stem cells (with not sperms nor eggs from human donors needed), and artificial wombs instead of pregnant humans gestating the zygotes until they become fully developed human infants. Then machines (and probably at least some human volunteers) could raise those infants to adulthood in some kind of state run and mostly machine run boarding school. It would be better to let the kids grow up in that environment than in a traditional nuclear family so that the kids can have a proper education, proper socialization, and not be groomed to be some pervert&#8217;s pets away from scrutiny. If people who have little to &#8220;offer&#8221; other than sex and reproduction are offended by what I say, then good. Even technology will replace those whores as providers of sex. People will have to learn to be self sufficient and come to terms with how insignificant they really are and realize that they only exist for their own selfish amusement; not because someone other than themselves wants or needs them. If they want to, they can kill themselves. If no one wants them around, I would condone they off themselves so that they do not take resources from those who do want to live. I think humans and their societies would be so much smarter, harmonious, healthy, and fun if what I proposed became a reality.</p>
<p>(If it were up to me, I would have all humans sterilized by default and forced to abort their pregnancies unless those people obtain a permit to have a child (which means that only the most fit people to be parents would be allowed to pass on their genes and raise offspring while the other parasites die off or hang on for an indefinitely long time due to life-extending medical advancements). I don&#8217;t mind if the human population (which is currently approximately 8 billion) on Planet Earth dropped by several billion down to approximately 3 billion as a result of people dying either by suicide or by natural causes; not genocide of course!)</p>
