<p>Last night I watched some videos on Instagram (including videos of animated sausage people twerk-dancing to pop Latin American music and being &#8220;relatable&#8221; basic bitches (and I watched it because it was rather grotesquely attention-grabbing and helped put my mind on more light-hearted things than what I was previously thinking about)).</p>
<p>When I woke up this morning, I saw that my phone screen was cracked, displaying lines of color, and unusable. (The phone screen already had some cracks in it from the times I accidentally dropped it within the past few weeks. Last night I presume that I crushed the screen even more by rolling onto my side with my phone in the pocket which was sandwiched between my body and the ground). Today I am attempting to buy a new one for approximately ~$80 and getting it online within the next 48 hours (as the AT&amp;T Prepaid customer service hotline (i.e. 800.901.9878) is allegedly only available between the hours of 9AM and 11PM Eastern Standard Time (and, in all the past times I remember replacing a damaged phone using the same phone number (i.e. (510) 631-9783), I had to talk to a live agent using that hotline from some phone other than the one I would be using as to register with my phone number). For now on I am using several socks as a makeshift phone case to protect my future phone from damage.</p>

<p>Update: I thought that I should let the general public know that, in my bedroom at my legal address, I have two minimally functionally laptop computers stowed away in storage bins in case my current laptop becomes unusable or gets stolen. (I have had several laptops stolen and damaged via malware in the past, including and especially while using the library Wi-Fi at California State University East Bay in Hayward (and, while there, I was also prevented from using the campus (even without using campus Wi-Fi) to answer a video call for a job interview I was scheduled to attend for a production associate job with Tesla&#8217;s Fremont warehouse). Also while near or on that campus, I dealt with some unleashed pit bull biting a hole in my leg, people cutting into the insulation layer of my laptop&#8217;s charging cable, people putting needles in my sleeping bag, and people chaining my bicycle to a bike rack because I left it there without a bike lock, and, also, campus police often told me to leave the premises while I saw many other non-students hanging out there with their dogs and little kids). Anyway&#8230;</p>
<p>I wanted to clarify what I wrote in the previous <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_513/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journal entry</a>. In that journal entry, I said that there was at least one person whom I would have thrown off a cliff which I knew was sufficiently tall enough for that person to instantaneously die when they hit the ground (and if I was convinced that I would not get punished for it). <span style="background:#ffff00">I am not a sadistic person. Rather than torture those who have tried to make me miserable on a long-term basis, I would much rather have such people quickly and painlessly exterminated so that I can live in relative peace knowing that such people are no longer going to interfere with me. I would rather have such people quickly and painlessly exterminated than incarcerated because I do not want to torture those people. I would rather just put an end to their conscious existence. I believe that killing them by throwing them off a sufficiently tall cliff would not be painful for them because, as soon as they make contact with the ground, their bodies would explode into many little pieces and the shock of the impact would knock them unconscious before their brains have time to register the subjective experience of pain. I believe I am very humane and less sadistic than the average person. Though I do not condone genocide, I do like the idea of quickly and painlessly exterminating all those who I would consider to be seriously detrimental to my goals such that the only people remaining would be those who are not seriously detrimental to my goals (even if that means that the total human population falls below 3 billion). I would not want the total human population on Planet Earth to get much smaller than that because I think that there would be too few people having kids to replace the people who die (though perhaps life extension technology would be if it is not already available to prolong every person&#8217;s life indefinitely (and, in that case, I would not allow the human population on Planet Earth to grow beyond 5 billion people and I would impose a strict limit of no more than two offspring per human individual within that context)).</span> There. I&#8217;m in a crowded, noisy place downtown on my way to the store where I hope to purchase a new phone. I am using a local public Wi-Fi to update this note. Time to go!</p>
