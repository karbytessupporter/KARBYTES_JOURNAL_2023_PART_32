<p>Last night I watched some videos on Instagram (including videos of animated sausage people twerk-dancing to pop Latin American music and being &#8220;relatable&#8221; basic bitches (and I watched it because it was rather grotesquely attention-grabbing and helped put my mind on more light-hearted things than what I was previously thinking about)).</p>
<p>When I woke up this morning, I saw that my phone screen was cracked, displaying lines of color, and unusable. (The phone screen already had some cracks in it from the times I accidentally dropped it within the past few weeks. Last night I presume that I crushed the screen even more by rolling onto my side with my phone in the pocket which was sandwiched between my body and the ground). Today I am attempting to buy a new one for approximately ~$80 and getting it online within the next 48 hours (as the AT&amp;T Prepaid customer service hotline (i.e. 800.901.9878) is allegedly only available between the hours of 9AM and 11PM Eastern Standard Time (and, in all the past times I remember replacing a damaged phone using the same phone number (i.e. (510) 631-9783), I had to talk to a live agent using that hotline from some phone other than the one I would be using as to register with my phone number). For now on I am using several socks as a makeshift phone case to protect my future phone from damage.</p>
<hr>
<p>Update: I thought that I should let the general public know that, in my bedroom at my legal address, I have two minimally functionally laptop computers stowed away in storage bins in case my current laptop becomes unusable or gets stolen. (I have had several laptops stolen and damaged via malware in the past, including and especially while using the library Wi-Fi at California State University East Bay in Hayward (and, while there, I was also prevented from using the campus (even without using campus Wi-Fi) to answer a video call for a job interview I was scheduled to attend for a production associate job with Tesla&#8217;s Fremont warehouse). Also while near or on that campus, I dealt with some unleashed pit bull biting a hole in my leg, people cutting into the insulation layer of my laptop&#8217;s charging cable, people putting needles in my sleeping bag, and people chaining my bicycle to a bike rack because I left it there without a bike lock, and, also, campus police often told me to leave the premises while I saw many other non-students hanging out there with their dogs and little kids). Anyway&#8230;</p>
<p>I wanted to clarify what I wrote in the previous <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_513/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journal entry</a>. In that journal entry, I said that there was at least one person whom I would have thrown off a cliff which I knew was sufficiently tall enough for that person to instantaneously die when they hit the ground (and if I was convinced that I would not get punished for it). <span style="background:#ffff00">I am not a sadistic person. Rather than torture those who have tried to make me miserable on a long-term basis, I would much rather have such people quickly and painlessly exterminated so that I can live in relative peace knowing that such people are no longer going to interfere with me. I would rather have such people quickly and painlessly exterminated than incarcerated because I do not want to torture those people. I would rather just put an end to their conscious existence. I believe that killing them by throwing them off a sufficiently tall cliff would not be painful for them because, as soon as they make contact with the ground, their bodies would explode into many little pieces and the shock of the impact would knock them unconscious before their brains have time to register the subjective experience of pain. I believe I am very humane and less sadistic than the average person. Though I do not condone genocide, I do like the idea of quickly and painlessly exterminating all those who I would consider to be seriously detrimental to my goals such that the only people remaining would be those who are not seriously detrimental to my goals (even if that means that the total human population falls below 3 billion). I would not want the total human population on Planet Earth to get much smaller than that because I think that there would be too few people having kids to replace the people who die (though perhaps life extension technology would be if it is not already available to prolong every person&#8217;s life indefinitely (and, in that case, I would not allow the human population on Planet Earth to grow beyond 5 billion people and I would impose a strict limit of no more than two offspring per human individual within that context)).</span> There. I&#8217;m in a crowded, noisy place downtown on my way to the store where I hope to purchase a new phone. I am using a local public Wi-Fi to update this note. Time to go!</p>

Update: I noticed that, when I last attempted to the updated website directory starting with this web page and ending with the &#8220;root directory&#8221; Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com to the WayBack Machine, the WayBack Machine said that the root directory URL had been saved 25 minutes ago (and only one WayBack Machine save of a particular URL can only be no more often than once per 45 minutes and each unique URL can only be saved to the WayBack Machine ten times per day). I think hackers are trying to make me feel imposed on and inconvenienced by more adamantly than usual (and I believe it has something to do with me not being more desperate to get a job). <span style="background:#00ff00">One thing I am afraid of happening is that hackers will delete or tamper with the intellectual property I have uploaded to my GitHub account, WordPress accounts, social media accounts, and email accounts using my login credentials to gain access to any of those accounts. That is why I make a point of saving each web page I publish or update to the WayBack Machine as quickly as possible: to prevent those changes from being lost due to people who steal my account login credentials. What I also worry about is hackers trying to prevent me from making such saves to the WayBack Machine by those hackers waiting to save the URLs which I am trying to save before I have a chance to save them so that the changes I am trying to save do not get saved into the WayBack Machine database in time (and I worry that such hackers might also try to use up the allotted 10 daily saves before I get to save my changes). That&#8217;s a way of other people stealing my time and censoring my otherwise free expression.</span> (As I am writing this note, I hear people loudly trying to antagonize me from the other side of the bathroom door (and I am hiding in the bathroom because I am sick of being stared at by other people who seem to enjoy seeing me in pain). Also, within the past five minutes, people have been trying to open the door on me multiple times (and I would guess than number is more than ten). Thankfully, the door is locked from the inside and it&#8217;s a private bathroom rather than a shared bathroom).</p>
<p>I thought I heard men doing construction outside my house complain loudly that I was not desperate enough to get into a car in order to get my phone and to connect it to the AT&amp;T network in one day. At the risk of not getting a working phone today, I am fighting against what seems to be totalitarian pressure from bullies who are trying to force me to become dependent on a gasoline-powered car even though doing so goes against my personal ethics as an environmentalist and as someone who wants to minimize dependence on expensive private property (especially private property which I do not own).</p>

It is approximately 4:10PM at the time this paragraph is being written. I am not currently located near any accessible Wi-Fi network. Right now, I am sitting on the BART train on my way back from West Dublin writing on my laptop (using the Sublime text editor) after purchasing the same Samsung Galaxy phone which I previously had (whose operating system is Android) for approximately $60 from a Target store. What I noticed is the same irritating feature about this purchase as last time: the absence of a charging cable. What came with the phone instead is a rather useless USB-C to USB-C cable. Thankfully, the phone batter is pre-charged to 70%. How generous of the manufacturer! Also, without a Wi-Fi network, the phone setup wizard appears to be stuck in an infinite loop. I think that if I run from the Castro Valley BART station to my house, I might make it to the house phone in time to call the AT&amp;T Prepaid customer service hotline to setup this phone.</p>
<p>What I was thinking about including earlier in this note is some details I remember of humans seemingly tampering with my bicycle when I was not looking (and that does not include the many times people stole my bicycle when I left it unattended outside in public without locking it u). While at California State University East Bay (Hayward), I left my bicycle near Mikeljon Hall for about a minute to pee in the bushes. When I came back, I noticed that one of the tires was suddenly flat. When I rode my bike to Ohlone College along Mission Boulevard and took a nap, I woke up to see that my bike tire was also flat. When I left my bike unattended outside my dad&#8217;s house for a few minutes, I came outside to see that one of the tires mysteriously went flat. Also when I left my bike unattended at my dad&#8217;s house (either in my room or in the back yard), I got on my bike and discovered that the breaks and gear changing tubes were messed with and I could hardly turn the wheels nor apply the breaks. When I was walking my bike to the bike shop for repairs, I noticed some people (who looked like neighbors) standing by looking at me intently like they knew someone tampered with my bike and they wanted to see my reaction. All those events happened some time between 2019 and 2021. The significance of bringing that up is that I think people are opposed to me having a bicycle because it allows me to achieve my goals with minimal reliance on other people and without polluting. Also, people seem to want to force me to socialize against my will and to feel deprived of privacy and the means to avoid being harassed by people in the street (because such heckling is also a means to coerce me into staying house bound, car bound, and where other people can easily intrude upon me). Oh well. I hope people do not sabotage my agenda. They probably will if past trends continue. Hence, I expect my life to be an ongoing battle for self-sovereignty and self-esteem and self-honesty and freedom of speech in a world which seems to want to force me to be mired to a group ego at all times.</p>
