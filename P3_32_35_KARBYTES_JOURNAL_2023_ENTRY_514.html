<p>Last night I watched some videos on Instagram (including videos of animated sausage people twerk-dancing to pop Latin American music and being &#8220;relatable&#8221; basic bitches (and I watched it because it was rather grotesquely attention-grabbing and helped put my mind on more light-hearted things than what I was previously thinking about)).</p>
<p>When I woke up this morning, I saw that my phone screen was cracked, displaying lines of color, and unusable. (The phone screen already had some cracks in it from the times I accidentally dropped it within the past few weeks. Last night I presume that I crushed the screen even more by rolling onto my side with my phone in the pocket which was sandwiched between my body and the ground). Today I am attempting to buy a new one for approximately ~$80 and getting it online within the next 48 hours (as the AT&amp;T Prepaid customer service hotline (i.e. 800.901.9878) is allegedly only available between the hours of 9AM and 11PM Eastern Standard Time (and, in all the past times I remember replacing a damaged phone using the same phone number (i.e. (510) 631-9783), I had to talk to a live agent using that hotline from some phone other than the one I would be using as to register with my phone number). For now on I am using several socks as a makeshift phone case to protect my future phone from damage.</p>
