<p><strong>KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_ENTRY_503</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Update: I neglected to mention earlier in this journal entry web page that, along with a baseline allowance of $40 per day, on Fridays my mom has been giving me an additional $60. I thought that was important to include so that the general public has as accurate as possible of an understanding about what my expenses and income have been for the past three years and likely what those expenses and income will continue to be for at least another year. Also, I decided to retweet the tweet I posted earlier which links to this journal entry web page so that it is prominently featured at the top of that feed. I reminded the equivalent post on my Minds account.</p>

<p>What I failed to mention yesterday (because, before I published the previous blog post, I did not want to publish anything which I thought amounted to &#8220;low brow&#8221; content or content pertaining to &#8220;petty drama&#8221; (and what I consider to be &#8220;petty drama&#8221; is what I consider to be a form of &#8220;low brow&#8221;)) is how I was being bullied via sonic harassment from law enforcement about how they want me to stop having so much free time and, instead, get a job (and they seemed to only want me to get a job in order to keep AJP from feeling jealous of me for having more financial support than what he has while he has no choice but to work to earn 100% of his money). My mom said that, as long as she lives, that I would not have to worry about money. She is a retired bankruptcy lawyer and has more than enough money to live on comfortably and to enjoy a leisure class lifestyle and she has been giving me $40 per day for the past 3+ years as a baseline allowance (and she gives me more when I ask her for basic things I need extra money for such as phone bill and shoes). I saw that a logistics company I previously worked for earlier this year for 3+ months and voluntarily left is hosting a hiring event on 28_JUNE_2023 but I decided to stick to my plan to remain unemployed until 01_AUGUST_2023 or later so that I can keep battling my demons, solving mysteries, and updating my websites full time (much to AJP&#8217;s and some other people&#8217;s dismay). I&#8217;m going to keep making the most of my life and living as though I only have until 01_AUGUST_2023 to live before I either die, get long-term incarcerated in either a prison or a torture chamber, or am forced to work 12+ hours per day 6+ days per week mining for coal.</p>
