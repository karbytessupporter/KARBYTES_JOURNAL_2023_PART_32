<p>When most jobs are outsourced to robots and when each human adult is issued an unconditional fixed monthly income in the form of discretionary cash and housing vouchers, adult humans could also (a) optionally work at jobs where they are needed for additional income or without payment and (b) optionally attend some kind of ongoing special interest group meetups for a minimum of 4 hours per month (to help prevent humans from feeling more socially isolated than they want to).</p>

<p>When I applied for CalFresh food stamps approximately three years ago, I remember only getting approximately $65 per week (which I think is very chintzy) and my food stamp coverage only lasted for three months because I was unemployed throughout that period and required to prove that I had a paid job in order to reinstate my food stamps.</p>
<p>When I asked my father how much money he gets in social security income (which apparently every citizen over age 65 years is eligible to receive), he said he got approximately $400 per month (and I think that is also very chintzy).</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, the United States of America does not provide adequate financial assistance to people without jobs.</p>
<p>My father seems to be refusing to do much other than harass me every chance he gets in order to spur me to get a job and stay out of his way (and ideally move out) so that he can finally relax and enjoy the rest of his life without having to worry about me interrupting his privacy, wrecking his stuff, and feeling obliged to pay for me using what little money he has to not starve to death.</p>

<p>Some people think I should rush to get a job before I do anything else today so that I can put my father out of his misery. I am just afraid that, if I do that, the job won&#8217;t make enough money to pay for me to rent my own place to live. Hence, no matter how much money I make, I feel obligated to live on the streets or at my mom&#8217;s house (and I think most people prefer the latter though I prefer the former so that I can enjoy what I think is sufficient privacy (and perhaps I can compromise by moving all my stuff to my mom&#8217;s house and taking all my showers there and saying that I spend the night there instead of doing such things at my dad&#8217;s house)).</p>
<p>Today I plan on leaving my stuff in my room at my dad&#8217;s place and taking out one of my circuit breakers (which has multiple electrical outlets on it so that I can split a single public wall outlet into enough electrical outlets to charge my laptop, two portable laptop charging power banks, and phone simultaneously). I plan on applying for jobs no later than 01_AUGUST_2023.</p>

<p>I can tell many people think that I should be bullied into looking for a job right now and to stay indoors at either one of my parent&#8217;s places until I get a job (and to stop hanging out in public like a homeless person) because those people are tired of seeing me take up so much space in public and, also, their attention span and, also, because those people are not interested in Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com nor in me finishing the renovation of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com. (The main reason why I decided to allow myself to keep living solely on my mom&#8217;s money until 01_AUGUST_2023 is to ensure that I have sufficient time to complete the renovation of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com to my satisfaction).</p>
<p>I imagine those people would say something like, &#8220;Hardly anyone cares about your website, sweetie. It doesn&#8217;t make any money either. All your website looks like is you showing off. It&#8217;s not enough about serving people other than yourself. We think you should let other people and community oriented things take up more of your time. That website should not take up so much of your time. You shouldn&#8217;t make such a big deal about it. Get some friends. Watch television shows other people watch. Become more relatable to us and then we will be more supportive of your existence. Otherwise, we just want to put you somewhere we don&#8217;t have to be reminded of your existence.&#8221;</p>

<p>I think that people are generally opposed to me not driving a car (especially as my means to commute to work if I have a non remote job). A bicycle won&#8217;t do. Only a car will (because, unlike a bicycle or walking, a car lets you transport more than just yourself and what you can carry on your back). Also, a bicycle is not fast enough and too much physical labor and exposure to the elements to enable you to remain non-sweaty, dry, non-winded, and non-grimy. A bicycle is for leisure; not for serious commutes. Besides, everyone in Castro Valley knows you have access to your mom&#8217;s minivan. In order to get the bullies to stop bullying you (and your family), you gotta get back in that car and stop walking around in public.</p>
