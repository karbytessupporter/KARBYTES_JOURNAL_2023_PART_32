<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>I have been trying for a while to wrap up all of my &#8220;low brow&#8221; journaling so that I can move onto journaling exclusively about topics which I think are more uplifting, wholesome, and helpful to readers.</p>
<p>Some of what I have written in the past seems to be a bit depression or anxiety inducing yet I felt that publishing such writings in the form of public blog posts was necessary for my personal development and to help my readers see how I overcame my &#8220;dark night of the soul&#8221; experiences.</p>
<p>That is not to suggest that I believe I am completely done going through &#8220;dark night of the soul&#8221; experiences, but I do think I have reached a milestone in terms of the blog posts I have accumulated on this website. What I published on this website thus far provides what I think is a good informational specimen which myself and others can potentially benefit from by browsing through and perhaps by feeding to an artificial intelligence to quickly analyze the entirety of and output a summary.</p>
<p>At this time I feel that I have spent adequate time compiling blog posts which pertain to some of the most difficult &#8220;dark night of the soul&#8221; experiences I have known across my 33 years of life as a human individual. The suffering I attempted to document in such blog posts was almost entirely the result of my own thoughts about &#8220;worst case scenario&#8221; situations and other very unpleasant subject matter which my imagination conjured up. What I mean to suggest is that I think I have had an exceptionally privileged life overall and I would say that my overall experience of life has been personally satisfying. I have never seriously felt suicidal nor do I expect to. I hope that my good fortune continues indefinitely into the future.</p>
<p>Whoever is reading this note may or may not be suffering (but I think that almost every person suffers to some extent at least some of the time (and suffering helps add to the overall richness of sentient existence)). If it is any consolation, based on my studies as a student of futurist subject matter, science, and philosophy, <span style="background:#ffff00">I strongly believe that every person&#8217;s quality of life will improve if that person lives long enough to benefit from the technological advancements which are currently unfolding and progressing at an exponential rate.</span></p>
<p>I will do my best to refrain from publishing what I consider to be &#8220;low brow&#8221; subject matter for now on. According to some people (and part of myself is included in that group), there may have been some controversial political, cultural, or psychological issues which I have not adequately addressed in prior blog posts. I really would rather let <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_part_32/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chapter 32</a> of the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_post_birthday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023 karbytes journal entries</a> be relatively puritanical. Some readers might not be happy with that change of subject matter, but I am the primary target audience of this blog. Therefore, I should publish content which actually pertains to my interests and which I actually enjoy instead of publishing content which panders to someone else&#8217;s preferences. Admittedly, this is a very self-serving blog; but I do think it has the potential to benefit readers other than just myself.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this blog post. I will do my best to keep the future content of this blog (and of my primary website) as succinct and high quality as possible.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
