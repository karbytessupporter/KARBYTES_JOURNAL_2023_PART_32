<p>P: &#8220;When you do psychedelics and philosophy and generate documentation about epistemology which ends up being as logically sound as a correct mathematical proof, other people will say you are spoiling the experience for other people by giving them the answers well articulated for them instead of letting them discover such truths for themselves and to use their own words to describe them just as precisely.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;My writings might sound very similar to what other psychonauts come up with and those people&#8217;s words might end up being exactly the same words I wrote (or vice versa). If that happens, I didn&#8217;t steal from those people and those people didn&#8217;t steal from me. Instead, we each independently came up with our own conclusions as a result of our firsthand experiences and learned how fundamentally similar our notions of metaphysics and perhaps physics are.&#8221;</p>
<p>R: &#8220;I would add to what karbytes said by suggesting that it is possible and likely for many computer science students to write the exact same beginner level computer programs for accomplishing specific tasks such as approximating the square root of a number using a particular algorithm. Either the students copied someone else&#8217;s program or else the students consciously discovered the algorithm for themselves through logical analysis and perhaps doing a minimal amount of research into the nature of the problem without verbatim copying the complete program from someone else. What matters is not how original one&#8217;s code looks. What matters is how much thought and enjoyment was had by the students who wrote the code (and that the code works). The complete working program then becomes a souvenir for the student to keep in its pocket to execute indefinitely many times again in the future and to rekindle the nostalgic feelings and eternal fascination involved in learning how to write those programs and contemplating their metaphysical implications.&#8221;</p>
