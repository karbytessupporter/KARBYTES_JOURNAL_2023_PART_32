<p>Update: A <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlife.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_110/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journal entry</a> from my older blogging website describes a dream I had which is relevant to what I thought about last night and wrote about in this journal entry.</p>
<p>Yesterday approximately two hours before sunset, I laid down in what I thought (and still think) is a safe part of the wilderness (northeast of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Chabot_Regional_Park" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lake Chabot</a>) and ate a pinch of dried psilocybin which I have stored in my backpack in a ziploc plastic bag since April 2023. The dose was sufficiently large enough to help my thoughts break out of their typical monotony but deliberately not large enough to cause me to have hallucinogenic and peripheral field warping effects (and the highest dose of psilocybin I did was approximately 7 grams but I might have &#8220;ruined&#8221; the experience by simultaneously taking 50 milligrams of cannabis derived THC in pill format and, maybe even more significantly, laying down in a place I did not feel safe from mountain lions in and which I always thought was a bit depressing: the circular cement memorial (located above a juvenile detention center, psychiatric hospital, and police station) inscribed with hundreds of names of minors who died from violence in the San Francisco Bay Area). Anyway, I pretty much just laid there thinking about the things which bother me and which the thought police were forcing me to pay attention to by interjecting words into my thought stream. (A major reason why I hide from other people is to attempt to have enough seclusion away from other people to hear my own thoughts and to not be in the role I feel obliged to play when in the presence of other people. It&#8217;s very hard to get away from other people without a vehicle and without a decent place to live. What I spent a lot of time thinking about last night was how I could not afford to go home every day because I feel oppressed and set up to set up to fight with my dad who seems to demand that I conform to his wishes like a puppet without him saying it directly. For now, the only way I know of to maintain an independent sense of self with its own thoughts, preferences, and habits is to continue living outside (and avoiding spending any more time than necessary in urban, heavily polluted, and trash and feces laden parts). Anyway&#8230;</p>
<p>The main reason I wanted to share this note and to publish it on <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a> is to record the details I remember of an interesting and subtly inspiring dream which I had this morning:</p>
<p>In the dream I was located in a park which is similar to where I was sleeping. I was walking towards a storage container shed which was long and rectangular (approximately ten meters in length and three meters tall and four meters wide). The outside was white and the material composing it was some kind of sturdy metal such as steel or some steel-like alloy. I went inside that container through a small door near the north end on the east side (and the door opened and closed on hinges and had a handle on it like a typical bathroom stall door does). I laid down on the floor. Then one or two days went by and all I was aware of was returning to that spot (as if no time passed) where I was lying down to see that someone had put a round light brown wooden table and matching chair in there. (I thought someone was doing it to provide me a nice sheltered and secluded place to sit so I could more comfortably work on my laptop and to help me from feeling so distraught over being deprived of a decent place to live because of selfish and covertly controlling parents). I decided to lay there for at least a few more hours before using the chair and table to make updates to <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a>. Then some teenage and adult boys appeared and I saw them and heard them through the open door of that container. I saw a few playing on bicycles doing stunts. One older guy walked in to see what was in the building out of curiosity. He looked down at me and smiled and I said hi. He gently closed the door. Then the entire container turned into a bus with deep blue fabric covered seats and I was the only passenger sitting in it as the shuttle appeared to be traveling along a zipline above the forest like the Monorail in Disneyland. I was <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_138/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">silently talking via thoughts to the thought police</a> about how it looked like a trap to abduct me and send me to another place I did not even plan on going to. The shuttle appeared to be going to <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Berkeley_National_Laboratory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a> up in the hills of Berkeley (and the surrounding forest is basically an extension of my original camping site). The bus appeared to be exiting 580 highway which was at the same level as the distinct architecture of <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Hall_of_Science" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lawrence Hall of Science</a> (which, in real life, is no more than 300 meters downhill and south of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory). (It should be noted than one of my first jobs was volunteering as a museum docent at Lawrence Hall of Science sometime between the years of 2009 and 2012 and that I worked as an intern writing Google Apps Script web apps and technical documentation for the Information Technology Collaborative Services department at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory from 01_JUNE_2012 to 30_SEPTEMBER_2015). The shuttle stopped in a train station like structure on the northeast side of Lawrence Hall of Science and the shuttle was suddenly filled with passengers. The shuttle appeared to be going back to the place northeast of Lake Chabot where I was originally at. I was talking to the thought police and I asked, &#8220;Is the person driving this bus a pilot or a driver?&#8221; No one answered my question. The significance of the question is that I was able to remember inside of that dream the way the shuttle appeared to be driving on the road at some parts of its route and flying over treetops at another part.</p>
<p>I wonder if the government implanted that dream inside my mind or whether my mind came up with that dream without the government trying to make that particular dream occur. The dream did help me feel better in the following ways: that there are other people who care about me and who want to help me and that my experience working at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (and Lawrence Hall of Science) are part of my ego&#8217;s fabric and origination. The significance of the dream was that there exist places, people, and organizations which I can be a part of and which center around natural science and technology. I needed that immersive reminder and escape from being too focused on the family instead of professional and hobbyist affiliations with other people (and the larger society in general). I want to be considerate of all people and not just those who I consider to be friends, family, and colleagues.</p>
