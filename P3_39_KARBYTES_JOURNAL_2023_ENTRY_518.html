<p><strong>KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_ENTRY_518</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Update: Rather than cap the total number of journal entry web pages in <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_part_32/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this chapter</a> at 40 like I said I would in a previous <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_512/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journal entry web page</a> of this chapter, I decided to extend that upper limit to 50. <span style="background: #ffff00;color: #000000">After I close this journal chapter, I might only make sparing updates to this website (and I expect most of the public online updates I do will be showcased in the GitHub repositories whose links are provided in the web page of this website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_code_continues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KARBYTES_CODE_CONTINUES</a> and according to the specifications described in that web age).</span></p>
<p>(One last thing before I close this web page off from additional updates: the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/meditation-techniques-do-nothing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;do nothing&#8221; meditation technique</a> has been one of the most effective and accessible techniques I have resorted to deploying when dealing with stress and adversity. I have derived innumerable benefits from giving myself at least one hour to as long as 24 hours of time doing little other than meditating and allowing my mind to wander freely and as it wants to instead of forcing it to do something which takes effort or which is relatively stressful. I believe that practicing &#8220;do nothing&#8221; meditation on a fairly regular basis has enabled me to have more mental and physical stamina than I would otherwise have and to avoid making as many mistakes as I otherwise would have (though I can tell many people are opposed to meditation because they think it is criminally self-indulgent and allowing of unacceptable thoughts to emerge)).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through">(Finally, I also noticed that, at times, other people seemed to loudly scold me from a distance for taking a few milliseconds longer than they thought I should to look around me or to stretch or to smile rather than pretend to be too sternly and myopically focused on staying &#8220;in character&#8221; like I am &#8220;supposed to&#8221;. I think it is because they think I should be at least as forced to be as stressed out and deprived of free time as they are. At the same time, I have heard many people many times insinuate that my thoughts are lacking in substance and that I try too hard to strike a pose and look dumb. What I am trying to insinuate in striked out notes like this is that other people insist on creating strife for me and then hypocritically complain that I am acting too uptight when they want me to be more sociable. They seem to be suggesting that I should make socializing the center of my life and the primary use of my brain power. This is not me suggesting that socializing and thinking about other people is a waste of my time. I do think that, in order to promote a healthy society which is beneficial to everyone living in it, the vast majority of citizens living within that society need to look out for people other than themselves regardless of those other people&#8217;s social reputations, income levels, education levels, criminal histories, popularity with the locals, religious beliefs, and superficial appearances. But, at the same time, I think that a society would be intellectually impoverished if its citizens lacked the support (and requisite time off from socializing) to develop themselves intellectually and to pursue introspective hobbies. Just as I wrote this, someone beeped their car horn. There&#8217;s a lot of cranky anti-introverts in this town it seems. Also, and in summary of this striked out paragraph, I have been told many times by many people that (a) I am too obsessed with my physical appearance and in looking good and (b) I have been rudely and unkindly interrupted many times by many people for allowing my thoughts to deviate away from constantly focusing on my superficial appearance. What that leads me to believe is that such people &#8220;secretly&#8221; want me to be an insecure and shallow bimbo so that they can ridicule me and have someone to feel superior to).</span></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p><span style="background: #ffff00">The purpose of this note is to highlight my new biggest goal (which takes precedence over trying to live forever or to make my intellectual property last in material form forever): <u>getting my personal affairs in order before I die.</u> What that means is getting my personal life (i.e. personal conduct, encompassing circumstances, and logistical, economic, legal, and social matters) as to my liking as possible (even while knowing that it is extremely likely that I will die and that, eventually and probably, my intellectual property will cease to exist in phenomenal form and will, instead be entirely noumenal. After I get my personal affairs in order (which I expect to happen by 01_AUGUST_2023), I will have an easier time getting and keeping a job and doing what I need to do in order to take care of myself and be a contributing member of society (i.e. someone who is more of a helpful asset than burden to people other than myself; someone who generally gives more to others than takes from others).</span></p>
<p><em>(I seem to be writing as though going to work is the same thing as dying. I really don&#8217;t think going to work is as limiting of my freedom of thought and behavior as is physically dying out of this universe. I don&#8217;t even think getting a full-time job working 12+ hour shifts 5+ days a week in a factory is nearly as bad as going to prison or being locked up in a mental hospital or nursing home. Hence, a part of me already is prepared (right now) to hop on a BART train and clock into my imaginary shift as a production associate on the assembly line at the Tesla factory in Fremont motivated by the prospect of me earning $20+ per hour doing that job. Anyway, the reason I am acting as though I am going off to prison, getting drafted into the front lines of a bloody war, or being directly killed after 01_AUGUST_2023 is because doing so is a rather fucked up game I enjoy playing and which motivates me to do the best job I can with what I have managing and finalizing the most important aspects of my life so that I can (relatively speaking) effectively, effortlessly, and painlessly metaphorically die and move onto living a life which is not so oppressed from my point of view as it currently is. Though I have a lot to be grateful for and ample room and resources to complete my &#8220;end of life&#8221; tasks, I do honestly feel that I would have a (slightly) higher quality of life with a job than without one because having a job means that I have the means to pay for my own lifestyle supplies and services and not be as dependent on the government and on other people as I would be without a job. Being the sole or primary income earner of my own life means that I do not have to argue with other people nor explain what I am doing in terms of how I use my money because that money belongs to me. Money that I do not earn from working feels like donations from other people (which means that, even though it is technically my money once it is deposited in my bank account or sent to my PayPal account or the donation transaction is already finalized by the payment processing service, I did not, in my opinion, make money. Instead, I got money which someone other than myself made. So if I lived on social security income, I would be receiving money which other people earned via working and paid in the form of being taxed. Being completely or primarly dependent on other people paying taxes makes me feel uncomfortable because it is implicitly slavery: making other people work while I sit on my ass and rake in their earnings to fund my vacation lifestyle. This is to say nothing about the outsourcing of jobs (especially low-skilled jobs) to robots. A lot of people (especially those who depend on low-skilled jobs for the bulk of their income) seem opposed to robots taking over their jobs. That is why I have advocated for allowing such people to keep receiving the same (or higher) amount of pay they normally get from those jobs while robots take over more aspects of those jobs. I hear people barking across the street as I write this seemingly in protest about what I am saying. What is a blue collar worker supposed to do: just sit there and watch a machine do all his tasks which made him feel like a self-made man? How much of the delayed onset of a universal basic income and job automation is a result of catering to the machismo of blue collar men? I think a lot is. I am afraid that such people have the same essential discomfort I have about being made to feel obsolete and relegated to relative (or actual) unemployment. In my ideal world, everyone would be issued a minimum basic income no matter how much they work so that they never have to apply for funds they don&#8217;t have in case they abruptly lose their job; so that there is no gap between them getting the money they need to survive and employment periods. Non remote jobs give people a socially acceptable excuse to leave the house and to drive around in a car rather than to go crazy from cabin fever. In my ideal world, people like me would not have that hard of a time working from home because they would have a place to live which they do not have to share with other inhabitants such as spouses, kids, relatives, and even friends. I think that people like me (i.e. those who want to live alone and to be more asocial than what is considered to be normal) should be elligible to live for free in tiny apartments which are no bigger than a typical Motel 6 room. I would be very happy with such an arangement. Anyway, that&#8217;s just me daydreaming. Time to get back to writing the main content of this journal entry and shipping it off to my social media platforms).</em></p>

<p>Yup. The DONATIONS_SECTION portal of both websites has been removed from Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and from Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com (but <span style="background: #ffff00">my Patreon account is still active as a Patron only; not as a creator</span>). <span style="text-decoration: line-through">As I write this, people honk angrily. Earlier today when I was thinking about buying a hand-powered portable bicycle tire pump from Amazon, some angry dickhead almost swerved into me as I was crossing the street. As I work to quickly (but without sacrificing quality) finalize my &#8220;end of life&#8221; affairs, other people seem very impatient and butthurt about me finishing (which makes me think that no amount of time would ever be sufficient to finish such things (which is why I treat this as a full-time and very intensive job that demands pretty much all of my time (but not to the extent that I am not available to be a good samiritan as needed because,</span> <span style="background: #ffff00">like every other able bodied citizen, it is my civic duty and personal ethical conviction to help other people who appear to urgently and seriously need help in my midst rather than to ignore them</span>))).</p>
<p><em>(I have neglected to say this until now: my laptop has been shutting down randomly again (seemingly in response to me typing something &#8220;check point-y&#8221; or else shaking the laptop with sufficient force) since 28_JUNE_2023. I think I have plenty of adversity to deal with at this time in my life (though I strongly suspect many people wish I was beset with more adversity than what I am currently beset with)).</em></p>
