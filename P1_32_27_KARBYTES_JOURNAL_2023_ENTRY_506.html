<p>Two sleep-wake cycles ago, I transitioned from sleep to wake while dreaming about writing a piece of code which was intended to update my encompassing physical universe at a metaphorical level. As my dream was fading and as my awareness of this realm (the one I refer to as the wake realm and not the sleep dream realm) was increasing, I was thinking about opening my laptop to upload that code to GitHub before the dream faded and my code disappeared. Then I sadly realized my code was not in the wake world but, instead, in the sleep dream world (but part of what I am attempting to do in all the realms I visit and even inhabit as a resident with a home, occupation, hobbies, and a social life is <span style="background:#ffff00">contribute digital artifacts to a trans-realm repository such that sleep realm and wake realm can effectively share and preserve such digital artifacts which are identical digital artifacts between those seemingly separate and isolated realms</span>).</p>
<p>During my most recent sleep dream session, I had a vivid dream about being in a place which looked like a combination of University of California Berkeley and University of California Davis. I was wearing the same black shorts, yellowish green hoody jacket, and black Teton backpack (but in the dream it had red straps on it and a Go-Pro camera was attached to it). I remember running and trying to make a cool, action-packed video of traveling around the campus in some scenic parts and to speed that video up before publishing it on Instagram and uploading that video to GitHub and linking to that GitHub video web page via a new journal entry web page on this website. As I was running, several little brown bunnies and one big handsome buck crossed my path just in time to get featured in my film. It was like they were doing exactly what I wanted. There were humans around appearing to be enjoying the scene and having lives of their own. I got to a relatively secluded rooftop of a building overlooking a large body of water (which looked like the bay of the San Francisco Bay Area because the peninsula mountains were visible from my vantage on the east shoreline). I looked eastward and was ecstatic to catch on film and to see with my own eyes the rich afternoon blue sky and steamy whitish and slightly pinkish purple clouds illuminated by the &#8220;golden hour&#8221; sunlight while those clouds were moving eastward and shape-shifting at what looked like time-lapse video speed such that the clouds appeared to be moving several times as fast as they should have been. I thought I had a real killer of a video to upload and was excited to get it on the web. I woke up from my dream thinking about getting that video uploaded to the web but then realized I was having the same dilemma as the previous time I dreamed.</p>
<p>I wanted to share this journal entry because it gets to the heart and soul of what I think my life&#8217;s meaning and purpose is all about.</p>
<p>Lastly (and related to my dream anecdotes), I wanted to mention an idea for a meme I have based on some recent videos I watched. The first of those videos had some guy talking about his terrifying experiences using <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DMT</a> and the lingering after effects and how he felt that it was hellish to be nature recursively looking at itself (but, for me as a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science" target="_blank" rel="noopener">computer science</a> enthusiast and student and as a philosophy expert, I think such a revelation on DMT would have been perceived by me as a positive and interesting thing instead of something to be deeply troubled by because such a revelation sounds like confirming evidence about my metaphysical beliefs and ideals which are essentially a form of pansychism). What might of helped spur my two most recent dreams which I wrote about was another video I watched involving a three-way discussion between consciousness researchers about the nature of consciousness (which I admit to falling asleep to listening both times I attempted to watch the full video and, while I drifted off to sleep listening to the people talk, I had interesting and vivid dreams whose imagery and commentary seemed more philosophically significant than usual).</p>
<p>Anyway, the meme I would rather just write about instead of generate an image of depicts two frames. The left frame shows someone freaking out as while seeing that all they seeing is itself seeing itself and depicting that phenomenon as a nested doll like structure. The right frame shows a computer with a smiling geek looking into the screen of the computer to see the same scene as that smiling geek looking into the screen of a computer such that the scene looks identical to the first (&#8220;outer loop&#8221;) one but visually depicted on a smaller scale (and that image, like the left frame of the meme, visually depicts recursion in a nested set manner). The significance of the meme is that the left frame depicts reality in an emotionally dissatisfying way while the right depicts reality in an emotionally satisfying way. (There is a popular <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_PART_32/main/two_passengers_on_a_bus_meme.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meme</a> on the web depicting two bus riders on the same bus depicting a similar essential sentiment). What I wanted to infer about the left frame of my meme is how that person is unhappy because he is not a programmer who believes all of reality is fundamentally a computer simulation. Instead, that sad guy on the left is depressed about all he was brought into existence for as a human is to half-heartedly and reflexively give birth to new humans and to then be dissolved like his predecessors and descendants supposedly do; like all they are saying essentially is, &#8220;We aren&#8217;t God. We&#8217;re just the playthings of God. Nothing seems to be more fulfilling as one of God&#8217;s sentient toys than giving birth to the next generation of God&#8217;s sentient toys of a similar template. Otherwise we are just here for a brief window of time to marvel in confusion, awe, and terror about how fragile and fleeting our sentient scopes are.&#8221; Meanwhile, the guy on the right is essentially me feeling like a God within a God having an orgasmic megalomaniacal epiphany about how the scale of such &#8220;recursion&#8221; (or, more accurately, the fractal-like nature of reality) is infinite in both directions (which means there is no ultimate God who was not created by some other God and there is no person who is fundamentally devoid of the potential to be a God (and a God is an information processing agent capable of creating universes and manipulating the fundamental metaphysical fabric of reality).</p>
<p>The thoughts expressed as words on this web page are not very well refined but they do hint at what I am passionate about and why I am neither suicidal nor depressed (and why solipsism and social isolation does not really scare me the way it seems to make other people deeply troubled). Unlike those people, I don&#8217;t worry whether or not what appears to be other beings in my environment are <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">philosophical zombies</a> or if they have minds of their own because, as far as I can tell, they are all just figments of my dream while I am fundamentally and unconditionally the only person inhabiting my dreams which is not a philosophical zombie which I created for my own amusement so that I have characters to interact with in this very cool infinite fractal video game of a reality I am playing.</p>
