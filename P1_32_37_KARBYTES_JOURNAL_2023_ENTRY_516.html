<p>Today I set up my new phone by calling the AT&amp;T Prepaid Customer Service call center. What the call center representative needed from me was my name, phone number, IMEI number (which is printed on the sticker on the back of the phone), and SIM number (which can be found in the About menu option in the Settings app). After activating my phone, I installed some applications such as Instagram and a loud alarm clock with funny noises. Then I used my phone to call my mom to ask her to transfer me money to order a bicycle. She did. Then I ordered a mountain bicycle via Amazon which cost $119 but the total cost was a little over $240 for shipping fees (and the product&#8217;s estimated arrival date is 19_JULY_2023). I saved a screenshot of the order invoice to a private GitHub repository (for personal data). Later on, I plan to add a picture of that bicycle to this web page (or to a future web page on this website (or in a GitHub repository listed in <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_code_continues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KARBYTES_CODE_CONTINUES</a>)) after I set up the bicycle and take it on a test ride. After this journal entry web page is complete I plan on keeping all records of major purchases and relevant notes pertaining to the acquisition and use of items I consider to be very significant such as laptops, phones, bicycles, backpacks, shoes, and cars in some plain-text note and in the form of pictures in GitHub repositories which are listed in KARBYTES_CODE_CONTINUES rather than on this WordPress website directly.</p>
